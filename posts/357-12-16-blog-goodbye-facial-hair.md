So, I'm not quite 200 pounds yet, but I have gotten really sick of my stupid beard and my stupid long hair. So, this morning, I decided to cut it all off. Now I kind of wish I hadn't. I look a lot like how I looked when I was 11 or 12. I've decided that maybe no hair, no facial hair doesn't work for me. I need at least 1 to look okay. So, I've decided to grow back some sort of goatee or something until the hair on my head catches of. That will do nicely.

Nothing else has been going on, really. I'm making a lot of progress on my Christmas presents for everyone, as well as portraits I'm doing for money. Exciting stuff.
