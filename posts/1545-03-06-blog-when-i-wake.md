When I wake up to birds chirping in the morning, it's Spring as far as I'm concerned. I couldn't care less about your calendars and equinoxes. Birds=Spring. 

Last night I went over and played with my dog, who is still living at Fabish's. She's got a little more energy than the other times I saw her, although she still spends most of her time just sitting around. Apparently they act this way for 2 weeks after their surgery, so she'll be more playful in a week or so. She's also got kennel cough apparently, so when Fabish takes her in to get her stitches removed, they'll give us some antibiotic for her. I hope she's better at taking it than my cats were. 

Me and Fabish went to eat at the Olive Garden, then I went home to watch "The Watcher", which was pretty okay as far as movies go. I spent the rest of the night dreaming about my new remote control that I don't even own yet. 

Tonight I have to help my aunt with her computer. Damn it.
