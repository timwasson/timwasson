Holy crap. I just fixed my digital camera. It's supposed to turn off when you close the cover, but for the past few years, it hasn't. So it just sucks up batteries and is annoying to use. Since I've been taking stuff apart for fun the past few weeks, I took my camera apart, found the problem, and fixed it. Of course, it's still a craptacular camera I bought like 7 years ago, but I fixed it. And that's what counts.
