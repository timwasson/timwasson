It will also be lame, since I don't have much to report.

I went out to dinner with Mullens and Angie, to a really good Italian place I didn't even know existed. It was in a strip mall that I also didn't know existed, shoved behind some big old ugly buildings. It was very good. After that I ran to Best Buy and picked up a few DVDs, then to a few dealerships to look at Jeeps. Then I came home. Then I did nothing.

Well, that's not exactly true, but one of you knows what I'm talking about when I say "nothing" is an exaggeration.

I wanted to get some painting done last night, but didn't. I will tonight though. I will also go to bed at 11 or after, since I have been doing that lately and have been more awake that usual. 

I may even have time to watch the Exorcist.
