I was cleaning up the mess I made installing a few new floors and loaded a bunch of quarter round into a garbage bag and started taking it outside. One of the nails in the quarter round popped out and stabbed me in the leg while I was walking down the stairs, which threw me off balance and I slid down the rest of the stairs on my ass. Now I've got a bruised butt and a cut leg. 

The good news is that I got a lot of old content up on my new site. If you're in the mood for a blast from the internet past, check out [Cardinal Deception: Live via Satellite][1], [Our Toilet Exploded][2], [The Crazy Old Lady Cam][3], and [The Steal My Shit Cam][4]. Coming Soon: NESpc, Mullens theCussing Retard, Ash on Jeopardy, Dead Bodies Everywhere, and All Alone. Maybe tonight if I get time and motivation.
