I know I have a month to go at this shitty job, but I'm already feeling about 200 times better. A big weight has been lifted off my back. I realize the freelancing thing isn't at all responsible and it will be a lot of hard work, and I realize I'm going to have to stop eating and start begging my parents for help in making ends meet. But damn, I'm going to be so much happier working much harder for much less money. It's kind of sad that money is the thing that kept me here for so long, although I feel better about quitting in spite of my raise. 

Last night I did some work on my webpage, which is taking way longer to do than I expected. I got a few phone calls, messed around with Fabish, made a cheesecake, and got set up the "Steal my Shit" cam for [hidethecam.com][1]. The project was a complete success, and we got some great footage of a shirtless guy stealing a porno magazine. Look for the update later today or tomorrow or something.
