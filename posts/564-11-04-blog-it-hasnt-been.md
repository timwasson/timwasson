It hasn't been that long  
Since we drank to the sunset, until it was gone  
And down with it went our pain and fear  
As we slowly broke contact  
more and more with every beer  
And we passed out in each other's arms  
Both admitting we'd never felt better  
Never felt so warm  
But awoke in each other's eyes  
Without wearing a stitch of clothing  
We were both deeply in disguise  
And maybe I just set aside  
The fact that you were broken hearted  
In my own special selfish way  
And if I hadn't set aside  
The fact that you were broken hearted  
Hell knows where your heart would be today  
Maybe with me 

It seems like it's been so long  
Since we kissed through the darkness  
Until it was dawn  
Up with it came our pain and fear  
That we'd already lost each other  
We both knew that the end was near  
Maybe I just set aside  
The fact that you were broken hearted  
In my own special selfish way  
And if I hadn't set aside  
The fact that you were broken hearted  
Hell knows where your heart would be today  
Maybe with me Maybe with me

Update on the party on the 'morrow.
