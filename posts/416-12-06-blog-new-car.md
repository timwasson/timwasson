I left work early yesterday to make the trek to a Chicago suburb to buy my car. It was a long, long, long day, but overall it was excellent because I drove away in my new Jetta diesel. 

The whole process took longer than it probably should have, and it included my dad and I taking the test drive to a car wash to get the ice and snow washed off so we could get a good look at it. There were a few problems with the car and it wasn't exactly as advertised, but he knocked off some of the cost which made it okay in my book. To be honest, I wasn't sure I could hunt down a deal as good as I got with this bad boy.

I was coming into a head wind on the way home, so according to my fancy new computer thing I only averaged 47.7 miles per gallon. It should have been over 50. But I'm still pretty happy with the mileage.

The other good news is that I know a guy with an almost identical car and he's hip to the biodiesel scene, even moreso than I am. We've discussed going in 50/50 on some equipment to do our own filtering and processing so we'll be able to make our own fuel. If I can get free gas for my car it'll be an even better deal.

Anyway, I feel great about the purchase, for no other reason than I'm putting my money where my mouth is when it comes to saving the environment, finding alternative fuel, conserving energy, etc. Oh, and the 6-disc in-dash CD changer is cool too.
