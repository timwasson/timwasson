So, work has been really slow lately and I have been very poor. All of the sudden, all this stuff is coming at me at once. It's a welcome change. I can't wait to have money again.

I'm also hungry pretty much all the damn time. People say that you lose cravings for junk after the first week or 2 of a diet. I'm here to tell you that's bullshit. I wanted McDonald's so bad today, but luckily Jaimee was around to distract me with a slightly more health conscious bowl of Mac N Cheese.

Still, though, I'm enjoying the whole shrinking process that comes with losing weight. Even though people laugh at me when they see my rollerblade and/or jog. Just wait a few months when I'm a skinny fuck again. They won't laugh then.
