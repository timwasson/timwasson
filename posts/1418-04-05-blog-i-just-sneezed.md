I just sneezed so hard it hurt my chest. 

Yesterday was the laziest day ever, and it rocked. Jaimee and I had been planning it for a while, since between all of our yard work and real jobs and whatnot, we haven't had much time with just the 2 of us to be lazy. Yesterday was that day. We slept a lot, cooked out, watched a few movies, ate lasagna, and did nothing productive whatsoever. Perfect.
