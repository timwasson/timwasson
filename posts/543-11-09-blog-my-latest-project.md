Well, here it is. I bought junkmachine.com, not knowing what to do with it, really. I put it up, so you can now take a look at it. 

Things have been busy lately.. I went in for some meetings at Iona today, and I will be there tomorrow as well. Possibly Monday too. These will be big projects in the thousands of dollars, which will be really nice. Iona has a habit of dragging me into meetings promising me riches, then not giving me any work. I should start charging for meetings.
