So, I ended up going to my grandma's yesterday after learning about her death. I got a ride with my sister and Robert, and we just talked to my uncle, mom, and grandpa. We went out to dinner at the nicest restaurant in Woodhull, which isn't very nice at all. I didn't really do anything last night, despite being invited along to both my roommate's adventures. It seems like they had fun, but I just wasn't up to it. Plus I had to wait around for a phone call I was supposed to get early this morning, letting me know the plans for the visitation and funeral. 

I got the call today. The visitation is tomorrow at 6, and I have to be there at 5:30. The funeral is tomorrow and will probably take all day. I went out and bought new clothes for the occassion this morning. I'll probably take a half day at work tomorrow, and all of Tuesday off. 

In other news, my web page is now finished. I'm still going to have to tweak it a little and rethink some of the text that I just quickly threw it, but it's very close to completion. Go to it [here][1] and tell me what you think. 

That's about it.
