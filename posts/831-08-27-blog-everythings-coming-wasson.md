Yep, everything rules right now.

iPhone: I caved. I bought it. I love it. It's so easy to use and gives me an absolutely insane amount of functionality. Worth every dime, for sure. No wonder it's getting such rave reviews from everyone who touches the little beauty.

House: It's as good as sold, which is a huge weight off my back and a huge relief. I can finally move on with the rest of my life.

Horror Junk: Look for us in Rue Morgue in about a week! And we've been contacted about promoting a horror movie for New Line and are getting some swag to give away for it. Sweet. People are interacting in the forums, emailing us, etc. 

Weather: It's cooling down, which is awesome. I was getting pretty sick of this over 100 nonsense.

Complaints: None really. Things rule.
