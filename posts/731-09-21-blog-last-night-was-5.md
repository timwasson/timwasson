Last night was $1 drafts at Gorman's. Since Fabish owed me for several things due to the repair of his car, loaning him mine in the interim, etc., he treated me to a night out. It was fun. We grabbed a few seats at the bar, which was nice, but limited the conversation we had since I could only really talk to people 2 seats away, at the most. Since I only really knew 2 or 3 people, I guess that didn't matter too much though.

I saw Dave McAtee again, as well as all of Angie's roommates. I hadn't seen any of them in quite some time, so it was nice to say hi again. 

And if that didn't make my day good enough, I also downloaded Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, which I burned to video CD and watched on my nice big screen TV. It was quite strange though... the lips only matched the words rarely, and the colors got sort of funky sometimes. Plus, some scenes played really slow, then played really fast to make up for it. Weird.

I also downloaded American Pie 2 and The Others, which I'm going to burn to video CD today if I get around to it. There's got to be a way to fix the lip sync and the fast/slow problems. Something tells me it has to do with a system clock. 

Also, I think the Jay and Silent Bob movie I got is a prerelease of some type. There were parts in there I don't remember from the theater. Bryan, Bryan, and whoever else who has seen it, was there a part right after Jay and Silent Bob arrived in Hollywood where they had a conversation with hookers about kinky things to do in bed? There were a few parts that stood out to me as new, but that one is the only one that comes to mind right now.
