So, last night was awesome. Me and Jaimee met up with Angie, Carissa, Brynn, and Alan at Gorman's. I hadn't been there in a long, long time, and I really missed their wings. I ate a bunch and was happy. After that, it was down to Kelleher's, however you spell it, where Mullens and Steph met up with us. Jaimee was feeling a bit under the weather, so I took her home after that, then met up with the group again at the new SOPs. Mandy and Fabish also showed up, so it was nice to see everyone again.

True Dat was playing, and they sucked. Every song they played had a "funny line", which was queer. They're a cover band, and not very good at it either. They did "Wonderwall" by Oasis, and at one point substituted "cock and balls" for "wonder wall" in the lyrics. It was really funny. Or something. Then they played "Down", by 311, but obviously they knew about half of the lyrics, tops. It was depressing to watch. And it was also way too loud.

Today I had to wake up early to go to work for a few hours. I'm still pissed off. I guess I helped, but not much. Anyone could have done the things I did today, and calling me in was a bit on the unneccessary side. I guess it's nice to get a few extra bucks, but I would have preferred a few extra hours of sleep.

In a while I'm heading to my parent's for my birthday dinner, finally. 

Polk, I totally forgot that last night was our drinky-drink night. My bad.
