I woke up in the middle of the night last night in desperate need for NyQuil. Other than that, I slept great and woke up after 11 hours of sleep wide awake, alert, and feeling good. Except for my stuffy nose and occassional coughing fits. But compared to how I've been feeling lately, this is a walk in the park.

Jaimee went from sick to injured. Poor girl. I have to go in and work for a few hours today, and I'll probably do a little cleaning around this joint. Sickness makes things messy.
