Last night I went to Richard's with Polk, where I had an amazing turkey and swiss sandwich and we talked about everything under the sun. It was a good night.

After I got home, I remembered I needed some personal hygiene products, so Winnie and I started the trek up to Walgreens, the slightly further away one for good measure. It was such a great walk. It was almost storming, but not quite. There was huge flashes of light and it smelled like rain. As we got closer to Walgreens, it started raining, so I picked up the pace a bit. We made it, slightly wet, and I got my shopping done. By then it was raining hard, so I called Angie to come pick us up and take us home.

I guess the moral of the story is that thunderstorms are awesome, but bring an umbrella.
