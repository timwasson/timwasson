But, in an effort to continue the new year's resolution of blogging, I'm going to try to blog even when there's nothing blogworthy to blog about.&nbsp;

We've had some bad news and stressful times in my family lately. We've been incredibly fortunate that our family hasn't really had a lot of trauma or emergencies to deal with, but that means that when these things come up we're relatively unsure how to handle it. I guess we're handling things admirably, but that doesn't mean there's not a general cloud of stress and sadness throughout the family.&nbsp;

The good news is that I've actually been productive at work, getting some things taken care of and making some progress on integrating myself into a new job. I've never wanted a job to work out more than I want this one to work out, so I'm working on weekends and evenings to catch up and work ahead a little, and try to ease out the learning curve that comes when you take a new job.&nbsp;
