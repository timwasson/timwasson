So, on Friday me and went to Kouri's Pub, which was a first for both of us. Hopefully we'll make this a tradition for every Friday. After I dropped him off, I went to John Zarr's place to hang out with the old high school crowd. The whole crowd was there... me, Scott Reyling, Scott Olsson, Steve Tendy, Brian Kelly, John Zarr, and Jeremy Johnson even stopped by. The only person missing was John's sister, Jill. We had a moment of silence for her before beginning the festivities, which was very touching for me, at least.

On Saturday I haded up to see in DeKalb. We walked along the river in Naperville, and ate at Chili's with Jaysa and Mike. After I got home, I went out to my parent's house for dinner with my sister, Robert, Jack, and my parents. I missed The Simpsons. I didn't do anything else last night.

I don't have a lot to do today, either. Maybe I'll start packing. 2 weeks left and counting until my homeless days.
