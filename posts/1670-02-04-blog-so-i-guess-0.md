So, I guess my persistence is paying off. I called the print shop that I interviewed for, asking for a yes or no response. Didn't get one. I emailed the guy saying I'd take the lower pay rate, and he emailed me back saying the job I applied for had been filled internally. 

The good news is that there's another opening that pays more than the last one. I interview for that one on Friday. It's still basically the same job I did at Kinko's, I think. We'll find out on Friday. But I'm pretty sure that 3 interviews means they HAVE to give me a job. Right?
