Last night Brice stopped by my place. I've decided to stop being to amazed when people reintroduce themselves to me. So, Brice stopping by for the first time in 2 or 3 months was completely expected and didn't surprise me. Or something.

So, I had my art class last night. We had a male model who was built a lot like Superman. There was a classroom full of drawings that looked like comic books. Naked comic books, of course.

And remember how I said I was washing my Jeep, because the 10 day forecast called for sunny days? It rained last night. So, I've decided that the only thing I can do that makes any sense is just never wash my car again.
