Yesterday was a good day. I got a lot done on my website, then went out to my parent's house to take a nice long bath and wait for my dad to get home. He took me out to eat, then out to buy me some groceries to keep me fed for a little while. 

The webpage is getting so close to finished now... Basically all I can do is wait for my programmer to finish his part and then tell me how to finish mine. 

The only bad part of yesterday: Somehow some of my groceries disappeared after I bought them but before I put them in my cabinets. I don't know how that could have happened.

Once again, there is no hot water in the apartment.
