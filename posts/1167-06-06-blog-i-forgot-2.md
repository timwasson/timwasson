I forgot to tell a very important story.

So, I was moving and unpacking all day yesterday, and as I was carrying a speaker from one side of the room to the other, I started feeling really light headed and woozy. I decided to sit down for a minute, since I may die or something soon. While sitting there, I realized that I hadn't really eaten anything in like 36 hours because I had been so busy and simply forgot. I had a couple bowls of cereal and was back in action. Whoda thunk that me, of all people, would forget to eat?
