Man, that was a busy weekend. I didn't have any quality time to spend with Optimus.

Friday I went from work to the bank to sign the papers for the credit card stuff. After that I headed over to Mullens' house to help him with some computer problems, which resulted in us needing to go buy a new hard drive. I got it up and running, but it took a bit longer than I expected. Jaimee and I went to Chili's afterwards for some good ass food, then headed home and started Scarface, but I was asleep by 9:30.

I slept a good long time. Saturday I did some yard work and tried to be outside because it was such a nice day outside. Brandon and Kristi came over later to eat and play some board games and kick my ass at Scattergories. We stopped briefly at Polk's fundraiser, and I stayed up past midnight. Unbelievable, I know.

Sunday Jaimee and I drove to Canton to deposit a check. We stopped at an awesome little diner on the way home. Then we bought some bikes, I took a short bike trip, then headed out to my parents' house for Father's Day. My nephew is adorable, my dad is awesome, Father's Day was good and the food was terrific.
