A few notes about today:

1. My boobs and my arms hurt because I've been working out. But I'm seeing results.  
2. I'm bored an awful lot.  
3. Getting back on a first-shift type schedule sucks.  
4. I'm having a hard time not thinking about the possible job I have all lined up.  
5. It feels good to have money in my bank account for a change, but watching TV is less fulfilling on a small screen.  
6. I'm all out of soda, and I'm thirsty for one right now.
