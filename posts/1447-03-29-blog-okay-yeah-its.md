Okay, yeah, it's been a while since my last update. Since then, I've ripped out a garage door, tore up some concrete, poured some more concrete, built a wall, and installed a window. All for my newly renovated garage, which I'll hopefully complete this weekend. Not the nerd-type behavior this blog is used to, but rest assured I also did some PHP programming, and worked quite a bit on my PVR computer. So it wasn't a nerd-free week or anything. Not by a long shot. 

I do have a lot on my mind recently, so I apologize to all my real-life friends who may be reading this if it seems like I've been ignoring, avoiding, and not returning phone calls. I guess I'm in sort of a funk, but trying my best to get out of it. 

Oh, more nerd stuff... I cancelled my Dish Network, which is what I always used to watch when I work out in my basement. Well, in the absense of Dish, I bought an iPod dock so I can watch videos from my iPod on my TV while working out. I'm now completely fascinated by video Podcasts and 100% convinced that they are the wave of the future. I have an idea for my own, but it's just a matter of making time to make one. Anyone with any interest in video Podcasts needs to at least check out Tiki Bar and Channel Frederator. They rule.
