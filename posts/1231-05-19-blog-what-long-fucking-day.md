I had 4 or 5 people volunteer to help me move out, but today when I called them, they either weren't there or found an excuse to back out. So, I loaded and carried 3 truck loads of stuff to my new apartment's garage, and a few more to my parent's house. I took a break to attend a graduation party for Fabish, Kelly Fabish, Pam Fabish, and a few others who are graduating with different degrees. 

Then it was back to moving. I moved everything I could have ever hoped to move by myself, and since I could see no help on the way, decided to try and move some of the bigger stuff. By myself, I got my couch and loveseat out the door and up the porch steps. Thank God that Alan got home just as I was about to try and load them into the truck. He helped me out with my couches, my TV, and my Donkey Kong arcade game. I helped him out with a few larger things he had. It was awesome to finally get a little help, since up to this point, I had done every single thing myself. 

I had planned on getting everything out of the apartment, but the moving today went way slower than it should have on account of no one helping me do anything. So now I'm left with 1 more load, including my bed and computer. I moved from 9am to 12:30 am, and I just got finished steam-cleaning the living room. It's been a big day and I'm ready to go to bed. 

Tomorrow begins my homeless period, I guess. I can't wait to just get settled into my new place.
