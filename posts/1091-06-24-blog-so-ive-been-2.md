So I've been abusing my new gmail account and the invites I was blessed with, checking on gmailswap and making people sing me Spiderman songs and send me Microsoft Paint drawings for an invite. It's fun stuff, and so far I have 3 pictures of people holding up "junkmachine" signs, which will soon find their way to my site. Good stuff.

My good buddy Brian was in town earlier this week, so I joined him and his family for dinner followed by a couple beers at Richards. He's going to be moving closer to where the action is, so I imagine I'll be seeing more of him in the coming months.

For some reason, I've had this urge to watch Cube again. I haven't seen it since I lived on Underhill and borrowed it from Brice. It's been a while. I don't know why I suddenly want to see it again.
