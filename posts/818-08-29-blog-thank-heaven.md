Thank heaven for piracy. AKA - Goodbye, TV. AKA - Hello, temporary financial freedom.

So I was all bummed out because I can't ever afford to do anything anymore and after writing all my checks and paying all my bills yesterday, I realized I was going to have to skip paying 1 or more due to lack of fundage. I've done that before and it's rarely a big deal, but it's still just a bummer when it happens. 

So I'm all depressy and bored and all sitting on my couch watching the same episode of Conan O'Brien I've watched many times in the last few days when I realized that I have a fast internet connection and Kazaa. So I pirated 28 Days Later and tried for Freddie vs. Jason, but came up short. But anyway, last night I had some good, free entertainment, and 28 Days Later was totally sweet enough to buy it on DVD when it comes out, if I have money by then. So I don't feel too bad about the pirating stuff, but then again, I never do.

And in other news, I'd like to bid a fond farewell to my huge, ridiculous TV. Goodbye, TV. We've had some good times, you and I. We've watched a lot of great movies together, and you've hurt my back on several occassions while dragging you up and down stairs, moving into 2 house and 2 different apartment buildings. You were the first major purchase I made after getting a good job, and it's sad to see you go. I will miss you. But I'm sure that you will enjoy your stay in Mullens' house, and I'm sure that I'll enjoy the $700 he's giving me for you. While I'm sure you're worth more, you understand how broke I am and how much I desperately need the $700. 

I'd also like to welcome back to my life my old TV. Hello, 25" TV. We have less fond memories together, when I pissed off the Circuit City salesman getting the cheapest TV I possibly could. You lived with me during the time in Chicago when I had the worst roommate ever, and kept me company on those long nights he'd be humping his girlfriend and kept me locked out of my own bedroom. Sure, your picture isn't the greatest and half of your screen has an annoying green tint to it, but at least you're a TV, and hopefully able to keep me slightless less bored while I remain unemployed for the next couple of days (hopefully) or possibly weeks. Or maybe years.

Last night was a new low in my poorness. Angie called, needing a ride from downtown because she was half drunk and didn't have a car. I told her I'd pick her up if she'd buy me a drink at Jimmy's, where Mullens and Andy and a few others were. She agreed, and I was on my way. When I got to pick her up, I was rejected, because she said her friends wouldn't let her leave. So I collected my drink money and went to Jimmy's, where I consumed a free beer and 2 trays of free popcorn (which, yes, was my entire dinner). Then I came home, driving about half the way while it sprinkled on my Jeep which had the top down. 

Hurray for my pathetic life!
