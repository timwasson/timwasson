junkmachine is still down, but since my new host kicks a ridiculous amount of ass, they switched everything to junkpit.com for me. So all the content is there, with just a few litte bugs here and there. They'll get sorted out soon enough.

I saw Identity last night. I loved it. It was awesome. I don't want to say too much about it, but it was a really interesting, though provoking movie. And very different from the typical Jon Cusack movie. I love that guy.

Today I'm doing more laundry.
