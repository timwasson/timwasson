Yesterday sure was exciting. I took the day off so I could take Angie into surgery and be the "responsible party" for her. It involved signing some papers, driving, and a whole lot of waiting. I took my portraits in and worked on them during the waiting part.

After that we hit Buffalo Wild Wings to put some food in her belly for the first time in a long time, then rented some movies and spent the rest of the night keeping her arm elevated. Good times. Mullens was there for a lot of the night's events, so I've attached a picture of him asleep as Angie and I watched Dodgeball. Enjoy.
