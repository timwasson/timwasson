So, my 1,000 hours at the gallery today turned out to be about 9. Not too bad, I guess. 

I had to return some DVDs I got for Christmas and exchanged them for a ton of old, crappy movies. I got the Sleepaway Camp boxed set, Kung Pow, Big Trouble in Little China, Jason goes to Hell, and the Time Machine. I guess The Time Machine isn't old or crappy, but still. Kung Pow was way funnier than I expected.

Jaimee has been teaching my dog bad habits, so I'm going to have to spend the next few days setting her straight again. I should get one of those little things that shocks her when she jumps on the couch or something. But those cost money, and I have none of that.
