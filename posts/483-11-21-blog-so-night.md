So, the night I went out with Andrew and Shep and we saw Zoolander, Andrew ended up borrowing the ED trilogy from me. He told me a good time to get them back would be if I met him at Iona today at noon. I showed up and Andrew wasn't there, but they were having their Thanksgiving lunch for the employees. I stuck around and ate some free food, which is always the best kind of food.

Andrew showed up later, and I talked stupid techno-babble to him, Jim, Shep, and Rob (who will soon make the job into freelancing like me and Andrew have). It was good.

I came home and did a ton of work, and then went to dinner with Steph and Fabish. I had planned on doing more work tonight, but I didn't get around to it. It's just so hard to motivate myself.

Tomorrow I'm heading down to Missouri with my parents for Turkey Day with my rich aunt and uncle at their cabin down there. I'm not looking forward to the car trip, although I'm thinking 8 hours in the car may be good justification for a few new toys... a Game Boy Advance perhaps? Perhaps... I plan on getting up early tomorrow to take care of some things before we leave at 2. We'll see how that works out for me.
