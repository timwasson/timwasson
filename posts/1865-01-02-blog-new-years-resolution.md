I almost forgot to post this. This will be the way I keep on track, hopefully. 

My New Years Resolution this year will be to make more memories. The life I'm living now is short lived, I'm starting to realize. When I'm settling down, starting a family, saving for retirement... whatever... I want to look back on these times as my best times. Little responsibilities... lots of friends, a great combination. I want to look back with no regrets. This is impossible, I know, but I would rather regret things I did than things I didn't do. So, this New Year I will not turn down invitations for things I have even a slight inclination to do. I'll be young and irresponsible for another year, enjoying every second and making sure to remember the good parts and forget the bad. 

I figure this is my last entire year to act like that. I'm closing in on age 22 now. By 23, I want to be settling down. All my friends will be in their respective careers, and it will be time for me to not stay out late every night, not go to parties every weekend, and not make out with any girl who will make out with me. By 23, I want to be looking for a wife, saving for a house, and driving a brand new SS Camaro. By 23, the life I'm living now will be memories, so I want as many memories as I can before then. 

My New Years resolutions from here on out will get me to the point in my life where I want to be. 

This year, I would also like to have a girlfriend and lose a few pounds. That's it.

Everyone else reading this should post their resolutions in their journals, and while you're at it, let me know what they are too. Deal? Deal.
