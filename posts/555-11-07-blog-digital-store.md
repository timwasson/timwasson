"Digital Store, this is Tim. How can I help you?"  
"Yeah, is this US Cellular?"  
"No, Verizon."  
"Oh. What about US Cellular?"  
"What ABOUT US Cellular?"  
"You're not them?"  
"No. Verizon."  
"What's the phone number for US Cellular?"  
"I haven't the foggiest idea."  
"Aren't they right there?"  
"No. They're upstairs."  
"Can you go see?"  
"No. I'm with a customer."  
"Well, they're not in the phone book..."  
"I can't help ya. We're Verizon. Not US Cellular."
