You know, it's amazing how short days are when you work 8 hours every day. Simply fascinating. There's never, ever, ever enough time to get everything done that you want to get done. I've been trying for over a week to get stuff up on eBay but never seem to have the time or motivation to do it. That plus a lot of other small tasks that just keep adding up and not getting done.

But, on the plus side, this working out thing seems to have started taking effect. I'm more awake and alert during the day, with the exception of this morning when I was slightly hungover and headachy from last night's Christmas party. 

But tonight is the night. I'm skipping the half hour work out in lieu of more productive activities, like updating a few websites for my dad, emailing people about job prospects, and, of course, working on my Optimus Prime computer. 

Freddy vs. Jason is out on DVD. Everyone should go buy it since it's one of the best movies ever made.

I'm thirsty.

I hate working in the mall.
