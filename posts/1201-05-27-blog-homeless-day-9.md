Nothing much to report today. Yesterday, as expected, I finished up repainting the spare bedroom. Today I went to Circuit City because my dad wanted more RAM in his computer. 

Later today my grandpa, uncle, step-aunt, sister, brother in law, and nephew are coming for a cook out. It looks like it's going to rain.
