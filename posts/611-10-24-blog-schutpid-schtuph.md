Well as per usual I'm outtie just a tad early tonight, but I wanted to add this before I left. I've been sitting her all day, doing nothing with the exception of a phone call or 3. I just got off IM with my would-be girlfriend who shall remain nameless. 

God, I don't know why she makes me feel this way. I wish I could turn it off, but at the same time turn on other feeling parts of my brain. Why can't I pick and choose?

Well anyway... this is getting suspiciously close to a bitching post which I would really, really like to avoid. I hate those damn thing. I'm going to cut myself off before I get to that point.
