June 10th-13th, I will be out in beautiful San Francisco, starring in my very own episode of The Screen Savers. Okay, well, I won't be the star, and there will more than likely be several other people sharing the episode with me. But still. I'll be on live, national television with my stupid Nintendo Computer, I'll have speaking lines and I'll totally hit on Morgan Webb. Kick ass, baby. Kick ass. 

I bet someone from a major network will see the episode and offer me my own sitcom or something. That is my prediction.
