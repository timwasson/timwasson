So I went jogging last night. I realize that I've put back on about 25 or 30 pounds of the 70 I initially lost, but I didn't think I was fat enough to yell horrible things at by stupid people sitting on their stupid porch or driving by in their stupid cars. I mean seriously, why would people be so mean? And at 215 and 6'3", I honestly don't think I'm fat enogh to deserve that. I'll chalk it up to them being in high school or really insecure about their lot in life, but it still pisses me off. I've been fighting off my mean streak for a while and trying not to be deliberately mean to people who don't deserve it, and its upsetting to see people who couldn't give a shit about other people. Or their own soul, for that matter. I don't know how they sleep at night.
