I didn't do much last night. I did an update to [hidethecam.com][1], then played some video games and things. I spent the majority of the evening trying to track down Premiere 6.0 so I could capture some video for the site, but illegal software is getting harder to come across these days, I guess. It took a while, but I finally got it. I'll hopefully be doing that tonight.

My sister was planning a cookout for this evening. I don't know if that will work out or not, on account of the weather. It's all dark and stormy, and we have a tornado watch on right now. As I was getting in my car, I thought "Good, it's not a nice day today, so I'll feel better about being at work." Well, I was wrong. Right now I really want to sit outside and watch it rain.

But anyway, if it's still raining tonight, and I'm guessing it will be, the fireworks will be called off, and I'll just go home and not do anything tonight. Actually, I'd kind of prefer that.
