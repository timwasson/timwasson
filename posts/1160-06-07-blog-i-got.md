I got a phone call this morning from Erin, calling from Columbia College in Chicago about my job. Unfortunately I wasn't here yet to take the call, and she's not there for me to call her back. Ah well, such is life. 

So, last night I went over to take care of Brice's dog a few times, and sometime in between the dog trips, I updated [hidethecam.com][1]. I did a lot of behind the scenes work which isn't easy to see with the naked eye. The only thing you can see that's different is that the web cam actually works now. It's not streaming, as I would have liked, but it works, and that's what's important.

I also bought Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, which I haven't watched yet. It will be good.

Tonight my parents, my sister, Robert, and my little cousin Kirk are coming to my apartment for dinner. Since my web cam is now working, you can go to hidethecam and watch the fun, fun stuff that will no doubt be happening. Or something.
