[Proof that I can afford the BMW of my dreams][1]

This weekend was somewhat uneventful, but good.

Friday was the celebration of my sister's birthday which was more than a week ago. We had dinner, then I took the family out to see "The Others", which was really freaky and really good. Afterwards I just went home and watched "Planet of the Apes". 

Saturday I went out to see "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" with [Bryan][2], [Bryan][3], [Diane][4], and Brian. Good flick. Afterwards we went to Perkins and had a little din din. 

I had to take Brian home, then I went to home and watched "Beneath the Planet of the Apes". After that I worked on getting the apartment's network set up (still not working yet, but so very close), and doing nothing in particular. 

Sunday I planned on being really productive. Let's just say I wasn't as productive as I would have liked to have been. Ah well.

Tonight, I will finish the network, I swear.

5 working days left and counting...
