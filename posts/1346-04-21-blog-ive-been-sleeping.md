I've been sleeping entirely too much lately. I don't know why, but it's been like 12 or 13 hours a night. It's kind of disturbing. I've decided to try and break that trend, starting tonight, when I'll go to bed late and wake up early. Eventually I'll get used to it, right?

It's been an uneventful few days. I've been trying to hunt down some Goldfinger/Sum 41 tickets (Sum 41 headlining... what the shit is that about?) and I've practiced drawing like an Asian man. I picked up some Anime/Manga books and have been slowly cycling through my old Anime movies, trying to pick up on the differences between Asian characters and Western characters. I haven't heard back about the comic book job, but my hopes couldn't be higher now. That's too bad. I was trying to prevent that in case of a disappointment.

I used to love Anime and watch anything Anime I could find. One of these was a movie called Robot Carnival. If the opening sequence of that movie doesn't give you chills, then you have no soul. My tape is old and worn out from having watched it so much. I really hope I get that comic book job. I'd love to be able to draw like them.
