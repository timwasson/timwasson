... like you have something to say but can't find the words? Like you want to express something to someone but don't know how? Like you know all the words will come out wrong before you even say them. 

I get that a lot.

I speak slowly about serious topics. I think a lot. Too much probably. I have a tendency to not trust people, but then when I decide they can be trusted, I trust them too much. 

In high school I used to not sleep at night because I had a lot on my mind. Girls, problems at home, not knowing where I wanted to be and what I wanted to do. 

I don't get that anymore...

... but I don't know why. I probably have just as many problems now as I did then. Maybe more? No, not more.

I think a lot, but I don't feel enough. I used to. Maybe that was my problem in high school. Maybe I need to turn on that part of my brain. I'm so nihilistic about so many things. Maybe my "fuck it and forget it" attitude has worn me down. Maybe I'm "hardened" to use the words of someone who's advice I take very seriously. 

Or maybe I'm just thinking about it too much.
