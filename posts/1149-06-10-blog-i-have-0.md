I have a meeting tomorrow at Iona at 1:00. Weird.

I just got an email from Jeanne, whose cube was caddy corner to mine. They need my 3D services, and quickly. I hope it's something I can do, and I hope I can do it quick, and I hope it's good enough money to take a big chunk out of my credit card debt. I'm doing pretty good hacking away at that stuff (lined it up so my entire next paycheck will go towards it), and this would help a ton.
