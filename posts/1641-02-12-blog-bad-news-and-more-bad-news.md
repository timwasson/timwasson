This is a fun time for me.

slashdot.org, a ridiculously high traffic web site, took it upon themselves to link to junkmachine.com. I got about 30,000 visitors yesterday and my site crashed. Today I got a call from my host saying I was 7 gigs over my transfer limit and I owe them money for it. And that sucks. 

My dad just called, saying the lady whose house we're buying is stupid. She hasn't been paying her bills and they're foreclosing. Great, except that means that we don't get the house. So, that sucks. It means that we need to close ASAP, and I don't really know how we're going to do that. This is just more stuff I didn't really need to deal with today. I just wanted to sit around and mope about being lonely. Instead I have to do stuff.
