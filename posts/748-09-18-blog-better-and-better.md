Better and better, and better still.

Everything's coming up Wasson.

I did the rush job for Iona. 8 hours later, I'm $350 richer. Not too shabby if you ask me. If all goes well, I'll have some cash by the end of the week. I'll have made in 2 weeks about the same as I made at Iona in 2 weeks. Not exactly the outcome I was hoping for, but at this point I'll take what I can get. This job is harder, but I like it much, much more. And if I ever get an illustration job, I'll love it.

I got another job redoing a casino's web page. That should be fun. I don't know how long it will take me, but hopefully no more than a week. It's nice to be working.

Tomorrow will be the 3rd day in a row I wake up early. I'm driving about an hour to take the final sunroom pictures, coming home, banging out the last scroller, then sending out a bill and calling that project finished. Yee haw.

However, I still don't have a permenant home for [www.timwasson.com][1]. That little problem is turning into a big one.

I promise this will be the last update on the number of freelance jobs I have for a while.
