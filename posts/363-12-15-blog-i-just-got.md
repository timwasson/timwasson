I just got back from Michigan. My dad bought some new fancy engine from some guy up there, and he wanted some company on the 6 hour drive to pick it up. We got a hotel room, which I will never do again. My dad snores. Loudly. I couldn't sleep. At one point I turned on the air conditioner in the room and slept on the floor with my ear against it, hoping the white noise would drown out the snoring. Long story short, it didn't work. I ended up just staying awake until 3:30 or 4 until I passed out from frustration.

While I'm on the subject of hotel rooms, does anyone remember when it seemed like every hotel room had those sauna things in the bathrooms where you turned the dial and the room turned red and got extremely hot? Those were awesome. What ever happened to those? 

Anyway, right before leaving for Michigan I got a call from Barb asking me to dinner tonight. Weird, sure, but what could I say? Her phone call surprised me and I was in a hurry to get out the door. I said yes, so in about 2 hours I'll be on my way to pick her up. It's a strange turn of events. I wonder what will happen.
