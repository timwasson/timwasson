I had my 10 year high school reunion this weekend, and shockingly, had a really great time.

I wasn't the&nbsp; most popular kid in high school, obviously, but I still decided to go and see who would remember me. A lot of people did, for some reason. It was really interesting to see what everyone had been up to in the last 10 years.

A few good friends who live hundreds or thousands of miles away were also in town for Thanksgiving, so we had a few dinners with them to catch up in a more private and personal way. Overall my reunion was a really positive experience, and I really wish that they'd have them a little more often. I saw so many people and made superficial plans to hang out with them in the future, but in the back of my mind I realize that we probably won't be meeting up anytime soon. If we were forced in the same room together a little more often, maybe we'd actually follow through with our plans a little more reliably.

I've also been procrastinating my real work like crazy, but today its back to the grindstone.
