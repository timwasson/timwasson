On Wednesday night I went out with Mullens to grab a bite to eat and a drink at Gorman's. While we were there, we ran into Dave McAtee, who I run into a lot at Gorman's these days. We chatted and got all caught up again.

Last night I went out with Mullens, Angie, and Callahan. We went to Lowry's, which sucked. Then we went to Gorman's and met up with Fuller and some kid named George. Everytime I hang out with Angie, I'm reminded of how much I hate her.

I have a lot of work to do these days, and have decided to undertake yet another project. I was going to spend tonight playing catch up with some of my work for Iona so I could go out with Wolford and Steph tomorrow night. Well, Wolford ended up showing up early, so I had to ditch Polk and him to get some of this stuff done. Ah, the life of a freelancer... I know, I shouldn't complain.

So, tonight will be lame, but tomorrow will be fun. And at the end of the month I will be quite a bit richer, so that's a good thing too. It's all going in the bank, though. No more toys for Tim for a while.

Oh, one more weird thing... on Friday I ran into Dave at Lowry's. He was with his sister Angel, who didn't remember me at all. For a bit of background info, I used to be moderately obsessed with her, because she's very, very cute. I was a sophomore in high school when I got a pretty big role in the school play with Angel, and I spent a lot of my time in quiet admiration. I was hanging out at Dave's house a lot back then, and Angel would frequently walk around topless and/or completely nude. It really bothered Dave, but I didn't mind it. When I was a senior in high school, she and her best friend Molly (who was Dave's girlfriend, by the way. I used to date Molly's little sister April) were stripping at Big Al's for some extra money. At that point I stopped liking Angel as much as I used to, although it really shouldn't have come as any suprise.

And that's the end of my story.
