It was a good weekend. Friday I did nothing. I worked on a project trying to get it out the door and get the money in my hand. Saturday I went up to visit Jaimee. It was a good visit.

I came home today to my check from Iona, which makes me much, much, much less broke than I was before. I paid off my debt to Fabish and still have a bit left over to pay off some credit cards. Once I get a couple other checks coming soon, I will be almost out of credit card debt. And none too soon.

I registered a new domain name for my latest web project which will be started hopefully tomorrow. I'm also heading out to my parent's house to get some laundry done tomorrow. It will be a busy day.
