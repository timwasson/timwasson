So, I'm a working man again. At Verizon. Or, rather, the Digital Store. I'm going to do some sales stuff, and they're also going to train me on how to repair the phones and do some computer/networking stuff. It's definitely not the job I'd love to have, but it's $9/hour plus commission. It'll be good to have money again, and since I start on Monday that means I can party harty this weekend like someone who has money.

And maybe I'll also go buy some paint, since I want to paint a few rooms in my house but haven't because I've been broke. Yay for being employed.
