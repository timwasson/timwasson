The meeting at PJS went well. Really well. I met some people who could possibly get me jobs in the future. The guy I was meeting had pretty much the awesomest job in the whole universe, but there's no openings in his department, nor will there be for quite some time. Hopefully I could get in with the advertising and move on up if they ever need someone new or something. Time will tell.

Iona still hasn't returned my phone call begging for my old position back.I'll call again today. Right now, though, I'm meeting my mom who is buying my birthday present for me. I like getting birthday presents.
