I took my first shower in my new place today, since yesterday there was no hot water. All I have to say is HOLY CRAP. I thought my parent's shower was high pressure, but it ain't got nothin' on this new one.

Still unpacking and getting this place set up. I got a satellite yesterday, but I'm retarded and have no idea how to set it up. My dad is coming over tonight with a level and a protracter to help me get the job done right. I'm pretty confident that I can get the rest of my crap unloaded if I just keep at it all day.
