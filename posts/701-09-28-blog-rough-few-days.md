Yeah, it's been a rough couple of days for me. Things have been better, but they've also been worse, and I'll end up on my feet just like I always do.

It's this "in the meantime" stuff that really sucks. Waiting for... man. When you're waiting for something and don't even know what you're waiting for, that's the hardest part.

But, thanks to all my buddies who came to the rescue, offering dinner plans and 6-packs to help me over the worst of it. I guess I thought I was over the worst of it, but to be honest, this waiting is way worse. The constant nagging that I'm being ignored, and that important decisions that affect me directly are being made without my input. That really, really sucks.
