I had a great Christmas. I got everything I wanted and more, and spent time with my friends, family, and loved ones. What more can you ask for? Christmas for me stopped being about gifts a very long time ago, but this was the first Christmas I remember being truly about family.

I bought myself a little present this year, an HD camera that records onto these fancy little cards, making it easier to capture and edit video. Below is the first thing I've made. I don't expect anyone who isn't related to me to enjoy it, but I'm still throwing it out there. Enjoy.
