Well, this vacation of mine hasn't been very relaxing. It has, however, been very expensive. 

I kicked it off on Wednesday by installing a new hardwood laminate floor in my spare bedroom. It wasn't a horrible job, but it made my legs hurt for days, since I had to walk up and down my stairs about a thousand times between the measuring and cutting of everything. 

Thursday I ran some errands and finished up just in time to hang out with Mullens and the male halves of the bridesmaids. It turned into kind of a second bachelor party with all sorts of drunken madness and a whole lot of fun. I had a great time. 

I slept in on Friday and spent a good deal of the day hung over. Then was the rehearsal dinner. The plan was to take single Mullens out one last time after dinner, but I think everyone was pretty much done with going out by the end of the night. I went back to Alan's house and watched American Psycho and tried not to fall asleep in the middle. 

And of course Saturday was the big day. I was up bright and early and got myself all tuxedoed out and prettied up and headed out to the church. It's always a bit awkward when you're standing in a wedding, with the photos and the long-drawn out periods of time when you feel like you should be doing something, but you can't find anything to do. The wedding went off without a hitch and the bridal party loaded onto the Party Trolley while we made our way to East Peoria. 2 Jager bombs and 4 beers later, we arrived. Dinner was excellent. The company was good. The drinks were free and plentiful. I took a lot of pictures, which can all be seen [here][1]. But here's my favorite:

That one is titled "oops", and it was a complete accident. I swear. 

So I get home from the wedding at about 1:30 and I'm half-cocked. I realize I gave my only house key away to Emily to take care of my dog for me while I was away. No one was at her house when I got home, so I took off part of my tux and climbed through a window. It was a perfect way to end the night. Or something. 

Today is a relaxation, rest, recovery day. Tomorrow is fireworks.
