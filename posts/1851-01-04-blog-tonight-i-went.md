Tonight I went out to eat with Brandon. I like that kid. Afterwards we came back to my place and played some Super Smash Brothers Melee on Game Cube. I sucked at first, but by the end I was kicking his ass all the time. Molly and Steph stopped by. It's always nice to see them.

Something I've noticed about myself lately: 2 years ago, when people didn't want to tell me things, I was totally okay with it. I think that made them a lot more willing to tell me anything. These days I get a bit weird and defensive, as if I can't be trusted when people decide to keep some tidbit of info from me. I don't like that as much. I'm going to try and go back to how I was before.

Alan wants to have a party tomorrow. I'm not into that.
