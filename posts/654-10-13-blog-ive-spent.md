I've spent the last few days working my ass off on these few projects I have going. It's so, so nice to be making money again. It's been too long.

I made a few more cold calls to different companies begging for work. I got some interest generated. I guess this is what people were refering to when they said it's 3 months of building contacts before it finally starts paying off. I can't wait for the payoff. 

Well, tomorrow is the Goldfinger concert. Reel Big Fish is also playing, but I couldn't care less about them. I'm there for good 'ole Goldfinger. My sister is having an open house, so I'll be there for a while and will be going to the concert with my brother in law and some of his friends. It should be a good time. 

Then Tuesday is They Might be Giants. It's quite a week for concerts. Thank God I actually got some money coming to me or I wouldn't be able to afford these shows.
