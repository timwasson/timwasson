I'm leaving for the weekend now, so once I again I won't be posting or replying for a couple of days.

I don't have any big plans for the weekend. I've decided to be a bit more aggressive in this relationship thing, so this weekend may be the time when I do it. Hopefully. Or maybe my nuts will fall off sometime between then and now and I'll do nothing. 

Since I didn't go out or do anything eventful last weekend, I really want to go out this weekend. If I don't, I'll be done pissed off.

Have a good weekend all.
