I loaded up AIM tonight, only to have it start playng annoying audio with some annoying movie trailer. When I silenced the annoyingness, I was rewarded with a pop up window which crashed IE. And it pissed me off.

So I took the leap into [Gaim][1], which is totally sweet. It only makes me wish I used more IM clients. 

That's my nerd tip of the week.
