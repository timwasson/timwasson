So, I've lost close to 40 pounds now. I've noticed a difference in the way I look and others have said they notice one too. But it has never been so apparent as when Jaimee got back her last roll of film. I guess it had been in her camera for a while, so there were old pictures on it. We used the last of the roll on Halloween.

Here's me at my heaviest:

Yeah, I saw a difference after looking at those 2 pictures. Weird. Just wait until I drop these last 40 pounds. I'll be irresistable, I tell ya.

And here's a picture of me with my ridiculously cute nephew and ridiculously cute dog:
