So, Pearl Jam's new album, Riot Act, is freaking awesome. After being really let down by Binaural, it's good to see them back on track with a kick ass, yet mellow entry. It reminds me a lot of No Code, where no song really sounds like typical Pearl Jam, and every song is very, very different from the last.

Also, Pearl Jam tried really hard to keep the cost of this CD down, taking the stance that less people will pirate if music isn't so ridiculously overpriced. As a result, I picked it up for $11 at Circuit City. You should buy it just to support low CD prices.
