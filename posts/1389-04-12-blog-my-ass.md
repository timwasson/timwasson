My ass is burning. My legs are in such agony. In an effort to end this silly diet thing and hit my 170 mark before June 1st, I've started doubling my normal work out. After my 4 mile jog today, my legs feel like they're going to fall off. It's ridiculous. I just took a long, hot bath to rid myself of some of the soreness, but the results were minimal. Ouch. My poor legs and ass.

Work today was uneventful. Tonight I'm seeing House of 1000 Corpses, after only a 2 year wait to see it finally arrive in theaters. Why are the good movies always stuck on the shelves for years? I can only pray that Freddie vs. Jason will go straight to theaters instead of movie shelf limbo for a few years first.
