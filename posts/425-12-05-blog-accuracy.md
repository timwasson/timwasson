The accuracy of that stupid color quiz made me want to do another one, so I tried one from [emode][1] called the ultimate personality test. Here's my results:

Hey, Tim, you're a Movie Star!  
You're a bright ray of sunshine in an otherwise cold,  
bleak world. Everyone loves your rosy cheeks and  
sparkling eyes, and you secretly wonder why you're  
not famous yet. You're friendly, charming, and great  
with people (and perky — you'd make a good  
Christmas elf at Macy's). Happily, your incredible charm  
means you won't have to sleep your way to the top,  
unless that's your thing.

So far, A-OK.

You're caring and optimistic. You don't get annoyed  
with people very easily, and you can handle stressful  
situations with ease and grace. Being a movie star,  
you need to look good, and that means spending a lot  
of time on your appearance. But you're not a snob  
about possessions — as long as you're wearing the  
best, most expensive outfit at the party. 

Um... no. I still wear a lot of flannel and pants I bought in 8th grade. I shave twice a week. I really couldn't care less what I look like. 

At work, you have framed pictures of your friends and  
family on your desk, along with a couple of cute  
stuffed animals. You like making your work  
environment cozy and hospitable. After all, you  
practically spend more time at work than you do at  
home, right? You never shy away from asserting your  
ideas and opinions, and encourage others to do the  
same. 

I have no pictures or anything decorating my little cube. I spend as little time here as possible, arriving late and leaving early. Everyday. But, not every online test can be right, right?
