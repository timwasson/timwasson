I think the subject says it all. 

Barb wanted to come over, chat, and give me a present that Nick got for me. Nick works for a video store and they were sent some banners for display with their new video games. One of these games was Evil Dead: Hail to the King. It has a picture of Ash holding his chainsaw. Since there's no place to display these signs, they usually just throw them out. But Nick stole this one for me. Pretty nice of him, I think.

She had a lot to discuss with me last night, and at one point started crying about everything she was going through, with her dad, her grandma, her uncles... It's a mess. 

At one point she asked me how I would feel being an usher at her wedding. I told her that I just didn't feel comfortable with that. She seemed to think it was weird that I didn't accept, but I wasn't even planning on going, much less participating.

The big thing she wanted to talk to me about wasn't a big deal at all. We had gone through this whole big ordeal via email when I kept telling her that she wasn't a good friend and I didn't have time for that. She argued a lot, and we both said some not-so-nice things about each other. But when her dad died and I went to visit her, even when things weren't okay between us, changed her tone. She realized what I was talking about then. That's what people should do for each other, and that's what I couldn't trust her to do for me. So, she wanted to tell me that she had been thinking about it, and decided I was right. She didn't understand where I was coming from before, but she does now, and wants to make it happen. I told her the same thing I told her a long time ago: I'm not going to put any effort into it until I see a ton more from you. I've been down that road before.

Plus I need more friends right now.
