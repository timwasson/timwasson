I was out running errands today. I deposited some checks, mailed off some CDs and VCDs, and stopped at Wal-Mart to return a shitty ICEE maker I bought. As I walked out to my Jeep after stopping at Wal-Mart, I noticed a huge, brand new 6" slice in my back window. Someone had cut it open during my 15 seconds at Wal-Mart. I was pissed off.

But, I can't let that get me down. I came home on my day off, ready to sit back and watch some daytime TV that I've come to miss since going back to work. My satellite doesn't work. Weird, I thought. So I called up DirecTV to see what the deal was. Immediately I was greeted saying I had a past due balance of $12 and my service will be discontinued until I pay. Bullshit, I said.

See, I got a free 3 months of Starz, which hasn't ended yet. I got my last DirecTV bill, and I was billed for it. So I called up to see what the problem was, and the operator told me that I would be credited for the $12, but I haven't been yet. Just pay the standard rate, and it would be sorted out. So, I wrote a check for $12 less than the bill, and figured that was that.

Anyway, now I'm pissed. I've tried calling DirecTV and when I press the option to talk to a representative, I get cut off. Fuck you, Wal-Mart! Fuck you, DirecTV!
