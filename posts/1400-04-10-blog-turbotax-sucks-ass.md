TurboTax sucks ass.

$60 for this piece of shit software. Like I can afford that. Sure, it helped me do my taxes, but for $60 it shouldn't be loaded up with advertisements for other software. It put all those annoying shortcuts on my desktop, like "Special offers" and whatever else. It's worse than paying $8 for a movie and having Coke commercials in front of it. If I pay for software, it should be as non-intrusive and non-annoying as possible. Right? Right.

Not a lot has been happening the past few days. Been out a few times. Got off my diet for some hot wings. I haven't lost any weight for quite some time, so I think I'm officially off this shitty fish/chicken/veggie nonsense. I'm happy being a 185 pound man, although I still want to lose this last bit of a spare tire. 65 pounds down, and not much left to lose.

I was supposed to hear about the house and about Screen Savers this week, and I've heard neither. I hate waiting.
