My parents took me out to Famous Daves last night, which was excellent. Then I had to help them fix up my dad's new office, carrying stuff from one room to the other and blah blah blah.

Not much else up on my front. Been applying to get more jobs, nothing panning out so far. I'm waiting for some feedback on the mosquito project before I get started on that. I'm not fond of these waiting games this job makes me play.
