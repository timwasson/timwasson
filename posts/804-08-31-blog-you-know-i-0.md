You know, I had a much better summer last summer. This summer has been good and all, but not the blow-out fun and drinky and wonderful summer last summer was. In an effort to make the best of our last couple of summery days, here's a short list of what I'd like to accomplish:

1. Drink more beer (which I've definitely been doing lately)  
2. Go to ice cream stands more often.  
3. More barbeques/cheddarwursts.  
4. More hanging out with people I don't know so well.  
5. More hanging out with people I don't see often enough (Dayv, The Brandon, Wolfie, etc., you know who you are)

So there it is. I don't have a whole lot of time to accomplish those goals, but thankfully they're not too lofty or anything.

Last night I went out boozin' and eatin' hot wings and having a grand old time. Tonight I think I'm picking up my new couch.

Bryan J, I recorded the first episode of the new LCS. You wanna come over tonight to watch it? 

And speaking of LCS, I just watched The Girl Next Door, which was awesome and hilarious in its own right, but words cannot express my shock and awe at Alonzo's bit part. Craziness.
