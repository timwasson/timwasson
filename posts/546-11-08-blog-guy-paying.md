The guy paying me for the cartoon has gotten kind of anxious for it or something, I think. He's kind of been bugging me for a sneak peek, so last night I sent him what I had done and talked to him about it. He didn't seem overly enthusiastic about mine, which was expected. I think mine is incredibly average. But he did say that mine was about 1,000 times better than the others he'd received. 

The way he was talking, it seems like we're going to do a lot of work together, which is good. Hopefully after this one, I'll be paid a more fair rate for the work I'm doing. There was even talk about a serial cartoon with it's own site "sponsored" by his site. All good talk, definitely.

I love being an animator again. I also love my elliptical machine.
