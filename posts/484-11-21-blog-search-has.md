The search has begun. I went out on Monday and handed my resume to a few secretaries who probably just threw it away. But that's okay. I did talk to the owner of one smaller company, but that was in Washington. The more I think about it, the more I really don't want to drive like 25 minutes to get to work. But still. The web designer position at the other place had already been filled. 

I am getting a lot of portrait jobs for Christmas, though. Lots of them. So, I guess I'm keeping myself fairly busy. 

Not much else going on I guess. There was some snow on the ground when I woke up this morning. That's 2 snowfalls in November. Is it going to be a white Christmas?
