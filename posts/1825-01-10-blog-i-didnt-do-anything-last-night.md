Well, that's not true. I painted a little and talked to my dad about Jeeps, then talked to Angie about our plans for tonight. Exciting stuff, I tell ya. Then I watched Predator.

So, this is Steph's last night in town. She goes back to Colorado tomorrow while I'm still at work, so this will be the last time I see her in months. I miss her already. She's one of the few friends I have that I can always rely on for advice, and honesty rather than just telling me what I want to hear. I'll miss that, even though I've gotten pretty used to it not being here.

Mullens moved to Eureka, which is a small town about 45 minutes outside of Peoria to go to school. It's not Colorado, but it's also far enough away that I won't be able to see him as often as I have been. I don't know whether that's good or bad. My friends are dropping like flies.

With Christmas break ending, all my other friends will be back in school, studying and stuff. Pretty soon, I will not have a social life.
