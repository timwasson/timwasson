Well, I went and did it. We did our usual Thursday happy-after-work fun, and got on the subject of running and marathons and a bunch of stuff. Under the influence of a couple of cheap Coors Lights, the inspiration of a marathon runner, and a slightly cocky attitude, I signed a make-shift contract on a crumpled dollar bill to run my first ever marathon in April. Truth be told, I'm in decent enough shape and shouldn't have too hard a time preparing for it. Still, there's something very intimidating about getting ready to run 26.2 miles. That seems like a very long way. Well, let's be honest, that's a REALLY long way. 

This weekend will be a busy, mad rush of tons of fun if all my plans pan out. I may have time for a couple nerd/PHP/mySQL/GB-PVR posts too. Exciting.
