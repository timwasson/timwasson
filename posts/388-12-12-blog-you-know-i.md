You know, I was just thinking about this for some weird reason.

I've kissed 5 girls in my life. 3 of those girls were random girls at parties. 2 of those girls, I don't even know what they're names are. Is that weird? And only once have I ever kissed a girl that I actually liked. That's weird too, isn't it?
