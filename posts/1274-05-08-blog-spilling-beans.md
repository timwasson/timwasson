The beans are spilled, and my it's no longer a secret. The news I've been waiting patiently to unleash has been unleashed. I'm quitting my job. I'm going freelance for the 2nd time. This time won't be like last time. I'm older, wiser, smarter, more skilled, more connections. I'm more focused, more driven, less naive. It'll work this time, I'm entirely confident in it.

I hate to leave my job though. It's not that I hate it here or can't wait to leave. I love the people I work with and I've made a lot of really great friends here. But I feel like I need to move on to bigger and better things. Clear my own path, make my own way in the world.

I've been freelancing for the past few months anyway with more business than I can handle. The small pleasures in my life are basically gone because my work has smashed them... Horror Junk, illustration, my social life... all suffering at the hands of my full-time and part-time gig. It's time to get my life re-balanced with a proper work/life ratio, because this work/work stuff is for the birds. 

I've been here 4 years. It's scary to leave. I'm not going to lie... there's a lot of reasons I shouldn't do this, and many reasons why this is a silly idea. But being my own boss, working from home, and doing my own thing has been a dream of mine since I can remember, and it feels great to be taking steps to make that happen again.
