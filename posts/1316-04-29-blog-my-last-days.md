My last days of freedom are winding down, and I couldn't be more happy to be starting a new career at a new job that I think will be perfect for me. Or at least good for me. I got a call from them today and they're busy setting up my computers (a brand new G5 with 23" display) and some PC... I don't know what kind of PC at all. Anyway, they're also setting up my voicemail, extension number, email address, all this fancy corporate stuff I've never had. Well, I guess I've had email addresses. It's a good time to be me, I guess.
