Okay, so I sucked at putting the quotes in every post. Such is life. My theme this month in an effort to lose some of this winter weight is to post my weight in every post, then see how much I can lose in the 28 days February has to offer. This morning: 222. 

The rest of my vacation was excellent and really helped recharge my batteries. I painted my dining room and hung artwork and moved stuff around. I hung out with Brandon at Bibo's while cleaning some of my grandpa's artwork. I saw Hide and Seek with Wolfie. I ran some errands and had some beers with Angie. Lame vacation, but it works for me. The only thing that could have made it better was seeing my boyfriend Polk.
