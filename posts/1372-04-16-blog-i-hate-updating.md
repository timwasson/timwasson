I love how pretty much all of my entries these days start off with an apology about how rarely I update. But this time around, there will be no apologies. Just the update.

Things are going really well for me right now, and seem to only be getting better. For about 4 months now, news has been brewing regarding my current job and its effect on the rest of my life. Well, I'm still not ready&nbsp; to spill all those beans yet, but the important part is that every day, I'm a tad bit closer to bean spillage. 

Things have never looked brighter.
