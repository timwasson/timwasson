I think I need LJ friends who post more often. It's a shame that I haven't added anyone to my LJ friends list for like 2 years. Maybe later today I'll just add every single person on LJ who I've met in real life. That seems like a good way to waste some time. 

Today a crazy old lady who I don't know was crying in my driveway because she had a flat tire. That was an experience.

Last night I went to Hoops. That wasn't much of an experience, except that I ate too much pizza. 4 slices. But it was good.

Today I went back to Pudik to drop off some samples of portraits I've done while freelancing. Hopefully I'll hear something about the job either today or tomorrow. I hope all of your fingers are still crossed for me.
