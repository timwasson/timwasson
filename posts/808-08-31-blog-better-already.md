I took care of some of my list of "things that would make me feel better", and they did. I'm a huge believer in realizing you can't change people's actions, only your reaction to it. I guess I just need to practice that more often, or somehow shorten the time it takes me to react better. 

In other news, I'm taking a lot of vacations in the next few weeks, including... wait for it... flying to California for about 60 hours to attend Brice's wedding. It'll be nice to see him again, even though I'm not going to know a single soul at the wedding. I'm just crossing my fingers that there's an open bar.
