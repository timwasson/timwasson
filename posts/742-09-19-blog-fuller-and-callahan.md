Fuller and Callahan stopped by last night. Ever since Fuller moved to Champaign, I've been seeing more of him. Strange how that works, eh?

Anyway, we went drunken bowling. Well, not really drunken, since it requires at least 3 games to get drunk and we only played 2. It was weird, since during the first game I was relatively sober and I scored exactly 100. The second game I was getting pretty tipsy and scored a 145. I should do everything drunk.

I solved my little homepage hosting problem. No more crappy Geocities, hello fast, good, host. Of course I have to pay for it, but it's only like $9/month or something. I also had to buy a new domain name. You're looking at the proud owner of BOTH [www.timwasson.com][1] and [www.tim-wasson.com][2]. Jealous? I thought you would be. 

It's 9:30, and I've already been to Eureka and back. I woke up way too early this morning.
