I stayed home with my dog for a few hours last night before Alan called inviting me to Old Chicago. I considered backing out, but then I remembered my resolution to spend more time with friends and less at home. So I went. I stayed long enough to drink my last beer for a long time and eat my last meal for a long time, then went home, watched Road Rules, and went to sleep. Good times.

And now it's back to the grindstone. My nose is stuffy. I'm doped up on DayQuil.
