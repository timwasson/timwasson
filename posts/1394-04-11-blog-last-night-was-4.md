Last night was spent the same way every Tuesday night is spent: helping my aunt with her computer. 

I'm slowly trying to get Abby away from her kennel, but I don't want her to start peeing everywhere. Last night was the first night I didn't lock her in her kennel to sleep, but she opted to sleep there anyway. She also wouldn't come out until I called her to go for her walk. She must like it in there. Now I don't feel so bad locking her away for the day.

I want to go to Garner's tonight. We'll see how that works out for me.
