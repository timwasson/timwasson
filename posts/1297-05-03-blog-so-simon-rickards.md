So, Simon Rickards is a putz. He emailed me a couple days ago because I posted stuff on junkmachine.com about him, calling him a fag. He emailed me, threatening a lawsuit, and I emailed back, telling him to shove it. Now he's changed the nameserver information on junkmachine illegally, and essentially taken the site offline. This is illegal and a total abuse of power on the part of a host. I'm pissed beyond words. I'm going to bitch and moan until he gets fired. I hate him.
