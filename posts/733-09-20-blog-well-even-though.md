Well, even though it's been a few months since I custom-built my website to handle all sorts of geeking out without an audience, I hadn't actually taken advantage of any of that. Until last night, I mean. If you're interested in what I did, click [here][1]. Oh, and ignore all the empty entries at the bottom of the "real" entry. I'll have to fix that eventually. 

Since I won't be around for the next few Fridays, if any of the regular or irregular Friday night crew want to break tradition for a mid-week dinner (preferably at Kouri's since our days there are limited), give me a ring-a-dig.
