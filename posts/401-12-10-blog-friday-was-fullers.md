Friday was Fuller's birthday celebration, so me, Fuller, Callahan, Mullens, Angie, and Renee all went out to eat at Damon's, then we hit a couple of bars before coming back to our place and playing X Box for the rest of the night. Pretty exciting stuff. 

On Saturday I went up to Chi-town to visit Brian Kelly, and planned on spending the night. We went out to eat, drank a few beers, and went back to his place and watched a few movies. I hung out with him and his roommates for the whole night... his roommates are nice guys, but huge, huge nerds. It's not like I'm the coolest guy in the world or anything, but these guys... well, they're just socially weird is all. We went to Mass, which is a horrible experience for non-Catholics. They had to wake up at 8:30 the next morning, so by 1 they were ready to call it a night. Since I wasn't tired and wanted to sleep in my own bed, I made the decision to just go back to Peoria that night. It's much better to drive late at night when no one else is on the road. I made the trek from downtown Chicago to Peoria in just over 2 hours. It was great.

Today my parents treated me to lunch at a Mexican restaurant, then I went to their place and did laundry, came back here, watched Simpsons, and here I am. Mullens keeps stopping by unexpectedly. I fucking hate that.
