My elliptical machine, the machine helping me lose all this weight and keep it off, died a horrible death tonight during my work out. Can she be repaired? I'm not sure. I'm calling tomorrow about a refund, but my hopes are low considering it's like 6 months old. And it's not paid off yet. Crappy machine!
