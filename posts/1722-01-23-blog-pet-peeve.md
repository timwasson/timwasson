My biggest pet peeve is inconsiderate people, but there's a close second, too. People who feel entitled to things that they're not at all entitled to. Here's an example.

I was at the gas station this morning, as I am every morning, getting my Polar Pop for my caffeine for the day. As I opened the door to leave, I checked behind me (as I always do) to see if anyone was back there so I could politely hold the door for them. Sure enough, a fat lady carrying a couple bags of chips and a few candy bars was making her way out, a couple dozen feet behind me or so. 

I held the door with a smile in that 4 degree weather as she waddled toward me. We made eye contact, and she gave me a head-nod, sort of saying "yeah, I see you holding the door", as she dug in her purse for her keys. After a few seconds of her moving at a snail's pace and me standing out in the freezing cold, I thought "ya know what, forget it." And I let the door slam. As I walked away from the door, I saw her scurry toward it, trying to catch it before it slammed shut. She gave me a dirty look as I climbed into my car, but all I could think the entire time was "scurry, you fat cow! When someone is holding the door, you SCURRY!"

Then I thought of a few other things. Like how I only "knew" this lady for about 10 seconds and I already hated her. She was inconsiderate. Inconsiderate of me, standing there holding the door for her in the freezing cold. Inconsiderate of the rest of the line&nbsp; as she took her time getting out of their way. Inconsiderate to the check-out ladies who got a nice cold blast of air as I kept the door propped open for far too long, waiting for her.

I knew she had an undeserved sense of entitlement because of the slow walk towards the door, like I simply HAD to keep that door open no matter how long it took her to get there. And by the dirty look she gave me, like how DARE I not fulfill my obligation by letting the door shut. 

I'm also pretty sure she'll tell her own version of this story about the guy at the gas station who slammed a door in her face as she tried to hurry out. Oh well.
