[another picture][1]

There is no hot water in the apartment. I refuse to take a cold one. I can't work until I shower. It's a sad state of affairs.

Last night me and Fabish watched 2 back to back episodes of Blind Date and laughed and made fun of the people. It was really nice. Those are going to be the things I miss when I live alone again. Granted, I think living alone will be much nicer than having 2 roommates for the most part, but I'm going to miss the little things like that. Ah well.
