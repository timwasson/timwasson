So, I've been sucking at my theme for February too. I weighed in at 22 today, which means in the past 16 days I've gained 6 pounds, lost 8, then gained 2 again. And now I'm back to losing.

My nights that I can cheat and eat whatever I want are reserved for Fridays with my boys. When I learned that this Friday is a no-go, I changed that night to Tuesday and ate a tenderloin and shitload of garlic cheese cracker things with Polk at the Patio Inn, which rocked. I also drank Amberbock. And made fun of our waitress behind her back.
