Ever since I decided on this freelance thing, I've had many encounters with many naysayers. A lot of people tell me things like "You'rs going to have to stop that DVD buying habit" and "it's going to be REALLY tough" and "Good luck... you'll need it". I know all that stuff, of course. I'm planning on supporting myself with freelancing, although I don't plan on becoming a millionaire with it or anything. Well, today I got my first few tastes of support.

At work, Jim, a really cool guy I really like, walked up to my cube. Here's our conversation:

"Hey Tim, I hear you're going freelance soon."  
"Yeah, yeah I am. By September 1st."  
"Wow, that's great. You're going to make a shitload of money."

He followed the comment with a story about his freelancing days and such. It was nice to hear. 

I just got back from dinner at my parents house. My dad told me how excited he was for me, although scared, too. I can't say that I blame him. It's a scary thing.

But anyhoo, I'm rarin' to go. The first step in the process is to complete my website, which I'm going to do right now.
