I have been having the best weekends lately, let me tell you. This one was both busy and fun.

On Friday I went over to Missy's house to see her for the first time since November. She looked exactly the same, except maybe a little thinner. There were 2 other girls and one guy, who I thought was her boyfriend until he corrected me. It turns out Missy's boyfriend lives in Maine, and no one really likes him. She met him while she was on Spring Break in New Orleans, and hasn't seen him since. It's a weird situation, but whatever floats her boat, I guess. Anyway, I had met the 2 girls on a few other occasions, but I had never met Josh. He was a really cool guy. Basically we just let the girls hang out with each other, and he and I smoked cigars and talked about cars. I wasn't planning on spending the night, but I drank a little to heavily and opted to sleep there. I left early the next morning, after helping Missy clean. It was nice to spend time with her again. It was sort of like high school, when there was never any tension or awkwardness, and we just hung out and were friends. It was nice. Now, don't get me wrong... I'm not going to start liking her or wanting to date her again or anything like that. I'm just happy that we can be civil again after so much bitterness and disappointment. Maybe I'm maturing as a person. Maybe the forgive and forget bug has bit me. Maybe I'm not taking things as seriously as I was before, and I'm not trying to read into them or force issues that don't need to be forced. Whatever it is, I'm happy things are the way they are.

On Saturday I went out to my parent's to let Abby play outside and do some laundry. I forgot my OxiClean at home, so I can't give a report on how it works in the laundry. Sorry. I know you were expecting it. I also took the doors off my Jeep and drove around like that for a while. My dad and I went to a hardware store to get some things for a project he's working on, plus some stuff to fix my carpeting that Abby tore up. I helped him a little with his project, then I went home and started on the carpet. It was a somewhat easy job, and out of the 4 seams my patch left, you can only see 1 easily. Not too shabby for a first try. This will be kind of an on-going job, since I had to rip carpet out of a closet to put as a patch, and now I think I'm going to put some hardwood or linoleum in the closet. I haven't decided. 

Anyway, on Saturday night, me, Callahan, and Fuller went to a bar downtown and drank a little. I was the driver, so I didn't drink a whole lot. In about 2 and a half hours, we had finished off 4 pitchers, and I had drank maybe 4 glasses. Needless to say, they were pretty drunk. Fuller started puking into his glass. It was the most disgusting thing I have ever witnessed, so we hurried him out as quickly as we could. Luckily I had just received information on how to deal with drunk people, so I put all those to the test that night. We went back to my place to pick up Fuller's bag, at which point he puked in my bathroom and on my front porch. I took them back to Callahan's, so he could take care of him for the rest of the night. I was really tired and needed my sleep.

I had to wake up early on Sunday and pick up a present for my mom, since it was her birthday. She was having a birthday brunch at Jumer's, and I needed a present before I got there. The brunch was as good as any other brunch, I guess. It was the usual group of Sarah, Robert, and my parent's. My mom talked to my sister, my dad talked to Robert, and occasionally one of them would say something to me. I need a girlfriend to take to these events, I think. I hate being the single one. I know they're not meaning to, but exclusion is inevitable in cases like those, I think.

After the brunch, my mom took me to pick up some shirts for the summer. I got some really cool ones, and they were all like $12. Not too shabby. I really like the fact that my mom used her birthday to buy me stuff. 

After that, I did basically nothing. I watched my Pearl Jam DVD I got on Saturday, which was amazing. I cried a few times. Not really, but it was good. Speaking of Pearl Jam, they're playing a concert on VH1 tonight at 8/7 central. Everyone should tune in. 

The 3 episodes of Simpsons kicked ass, but Jackass was weak.

And that was my weekend.
