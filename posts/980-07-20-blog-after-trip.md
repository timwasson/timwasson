After a trip to Sam's with Jaimee, I took a bike ride with Angie. It was supposed to be a short one, but we got completely lost in a cemetery and turned around without a clue as to where we were going. It was pretty neat. We popped out right by the bridge to East Peoria. Then we had to ride all the way home. When all was said and done, it was about an hour 40 minutes or so. 

Good exercise, but still.

Sleeping in an extra half hour in the morning is actually helping a lot in terms of me not being tired all the time. Or maybe it's the exercise. Or maybe I'm finally just adjusting to this schedule after 2.5 months on the job.
