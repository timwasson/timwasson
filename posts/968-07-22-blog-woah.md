Yeah, so my interview at the framing place just ended. I'll make $7/hour, which is less than half of what I made when I was working at Iona. I don't have the job yet, but I think I'll probably get it.

In other news, Fabish got engaged. Weird. The goofy fuckstick I grew up with is now going to get married. I feel old.
