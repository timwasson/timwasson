So, Alan got a bulldog yesterday. I don't want the dog in my house. And the dog is making Winnie bad. And they play too much and annoy me. And bulldogs are so fucking loud and never stop panting. And it's hideous. I want it to go away.

I can't walk anywhere in my house. I always have 2 dogs tripping me and getting in my way whenever I try to do anything. Winnie was getting to the point where she wouldn't have to follow me around anytime I went somewhere, but that time is over now. 2 dogs is too many dogs.
