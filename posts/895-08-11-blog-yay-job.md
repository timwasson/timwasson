Yay for job interviews! I was just getting ready to call Pudik Graphics about the resume I submitted for the illustrator position when they called me asking, no, BEGGING for an interview! So, August 21st at 10:00 AM I have my interview. It was kind of discouraging because she had to schedule me in, and made sure to mention that there's 3 days of interviews. That means a lot of competition. 

Anyway, I guess I don't have a whole lot to say about Pudik or the job position, other than it's good cash. Plus I get to say I work at a place called "Poo Dick". I realize it's pronounced "Pew Dick", but that's not as fun.
