Well, I ran into this site entirely by accident. My job isn't doing very well keeping me busy, so I have time to search out things I may have an interest in. I basically wanted a journal program I could type into, but posting it on the web seemed pretty cool too. I mean, I have some interesting things to say. Not many, but some.

I'm not entirely sure how in depth this thing is gonna get. I'll probably put a lot of bullshit on here that I don't care if people read. Not entirely the most honest thing I could do, huh? But, it'll work. I'll bare my soul to my friends, but not to strangers on the internet. Most people reading this are probably stalkers and freaks. Luckily I'm not attractive enough to stalk. 

So... I suppose this first entry should get you posted on current event in my life, huh? Here goes.

I just got back to my hometown after 2 years of being away in Chicago. I think I could pretty easily say those were the worst years of my life, but I could just as easily say that these are the best. I have a kick ass car (a Z28 I love more than anything), am making a decent wage for a job I like (when they give me something to do) and I have the coolest friends in the world. I also have a love interest who wants nothing to do with me. I suppose I'll get into that later, eh? 

I've been living with my parents, making the wage I do for quite some time now, so I've had a lot to blow on stupid junk like big screen TVs, DVD players, surround sound, and of course, huge ass speakers. It's been fun, but my financial freedom is coming to a stop sometime in the near future. I'm moving out. In about 2 weeks I'll have my own place. It should be good, provided the crackheads living across the street don't steal my junk.

That's about it for now. Expect more later. I imagine I'll type in this thing everyday from work until they give me something to do.
