Well, it looks like the deadly combo 1-2 punch of AJAXified comments and link filtering destroyed the spammers. Now I just need to better implement the user registration system, add RSS, and a bit of "look and feel" tweaking to call this project complete. That was a tough one. Let me wipe the sweat off my brow. 

Anyhoo, the 4th was pretty nice. On the 3rd, Angie and I walked up to Glen Oak Park to meet my brother-in-law and 2 nephews. The crowd was massive, the music entertaining, and the fireworks spectacular. We had big plans on the 4th to go down to the riverfront, but after eating on my back porch and putting back a couple cold ones, the group collectively decided to just sit it out and stay on the back porch. We'd already seen the fireworks anyway.
