When I was a kid, I used to get nightmares all the time. At least every week. Back then, they were always about how bad guys were trying to get in and kill me and my family. Then, for about 15 years, I never had a nightmare. Ever. Now I'm getting them again occassionally... just a few times a month. But now the nightmares are never about bad guys or me being killed. They're always about me breaking the law somehow and avoiding the police, the whole time wishing I hadn't done whatever it was I did. 

So, last night I had one that me and my cousin Russ kidnapped my nephew for no real reason. We were running from the cops and eventually they caught us. I remember thinking that I'd probably be let off with a slap on the wrists and Russ would end up getting jail time, because of drug offenses and such in the past. I can't tell you how glad I was to wake up.

Anyway, I wonder what these kinds of nightmares mean. I wonder if I'm nuts.

I finally broke down and bought Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back last night. I was looking forward to watching it, watching it again with the commentary, then watching all the bonus stuff and basically wasting my whole night. But after I got home, I noticed Mr. Affleck is not on the commentary. How disappointing. He was always the highlight of the other commentaries.

The new timwasson.com will blow your mind. Once I get it done.
