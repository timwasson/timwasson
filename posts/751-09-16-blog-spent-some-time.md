Spent some time with John Zarr looking at his new motorcycle last night. When it started raining, he took off and I took the opportunity to open the windows, enjoy the thunderstorm, and watch Night of the Living Dead. It was a good night.

Anyway, my job isn't particularly in jeopardy or anything, but people are getting fired and quitting left and right, and written up about silly shit and whatever else. I just need to stay out of the line of fire until things settle down. There's talk of weeding out the bad employees and bringing in people who want to be there and yadda yadda. I've been assured that this is a weird time in the company's history and people who have been there 12 years have told me this has never happened. So I'm gonna sit and out and see what happens when the smoke settles. 

So there's that.
