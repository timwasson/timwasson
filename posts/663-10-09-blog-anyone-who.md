To anyone who never wants to eat McDonalds or fast food ever again, I recommend a viewing of Supersize Me. I'm not sure how entirely honest the movie was, but it definitely scared me away from fast food for a bit. I may even be a bit scared of regular restaurants, although I'm not entirely sure about that one yet.

Quite appropriately, my day today will be spent fixing up my awesome gymnasium and assembling my brand new recumbant bike and trying to work last night's Chili's out of my system.

Speaking of Chili's, this is my public thank you to Polk who got me a very thoughtful Mr. Sparkle t-shirt in celebration of my 25th. I will wear it proudly.
