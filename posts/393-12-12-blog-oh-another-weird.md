Oh, another weird thing.

I went to high school with this girl named Ann Smolen, who I never really talked to and who I haven't seen or heard from (or even heard of) since I graduated. She was one of those girls who everyone secretly had a crush on, but who never had a boyfriend for some reason. 

Anyway, last night I had a dream that she and I were dating, and I was living in an upscale apartment in Chicago with a butler and a pet elephant, that actually more resembled a dinosaur than an elephant. Ann and I would make home-made champaign and walk our pet elephant... it was all very bizarre. I wonder where that came from.
