Today at 3:23, my second nephew, Peter Joseph, was born. As of right now, it's unsure whether or not our matching middle names are a coincidence. I'd like to think it's not.

He was big by some standards, but not by Wasson standards. 8 lbs, 12 ounces, and 21 inches long. Tell me congratulations now.
