Sometime around my posting time on Saturday, I decided my entire 4 day Turkey Day weekend was shot. There was no hope to turn it into a productive weekend, so rather than try to force myself to do stuff I didn't want to do (IE- laundry, cleaning, portraits, etc.), I simply sat around. Like Peter from Office Space, I did absolutely nothing and it was everything I hoped it would be. We even canceled plans for National Treasure, instead opting to keep sitting around (but with Angie at this point), and watch some TV. I had gone out on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, so come Saturday I was ready to stay in, not spend money, and relax.

The Thanksgiving feast continued on Sunday when I managed to get a hold of Polk and head to Dynasty for some wonderful Americanized Chinese food. Angie and I once again skipped our National Treasure plans, since I was knee deep in a "100 greatest TV characters of all time" marathon and didn't really want to leave my couch. Overall, this was a perfect weekend.

Things I'm thankful for this year: Getting an awesome job, getting an awesome new nephew, getting closer to my family, paying off a huge chunk of my credit card debt, having friends and family to celebrate my birthday and various other occasions with, having to make the decision to stay in while getting invited out, getting an awesome job (so awesome it deserves 2 mentions), and being fortunate enough to be able to fill an entire month's entries with facts and memories without really running out of them. 

Fact: When I was a kid, my family and I raised rabbits. We stopped raising them when my favorite rabbit, Butterscotch, got some kind of infection and had to be put to sleep. I think I was around 7 or 8. 

Memory: Stephanie went with me to help me move the remaining junk out of my apartment in Chicago when I moved back home. That night, we saw Spike and Mike's Animation Festival, and had to walk through Boy's Town to get there. While walking through, Stephanie kept giving me tips on how to tell whether a guy was checking me out. I think it was the only time in history I was getting more looks than Stephanie.
