I am really, really sick. And it sucks.

Last night I came home, got Abby, and took her on a 15 or 20 minute walk. The entire time she looked at me like she didn't know what I wanted her to do. Finally I gave up and put her in my car and headed off to my parent's, who were anxious to meet her. While in the car, she kept squating like she was going to pee, so I'd yell at her and she'd back off. Finally I get to my parent's and keep her outside for a while longer, hoping she'll go to the bathroom. No such luck. I take her inside and she promptly runs to our living room and pees all over the floor. This is the 3rd time she's done this now. Stupid dog. 

Dinner was okay. Sarah and Robert came and we ate at diner near their house. My dad got a new computer, so I put it together and set it up for him because I'm such a good son. 

I had to grab a few things Fabish wanted to borrow, then it was back off to my place. I took him the things he needed, then it was finally time to sit and do nothing.

At about 9, Alan's brother called and asked if I would buy him beer. I told him no, because I was going to go to bed soon because I wasn't feeling well. Then he informed me that I better feel better today because he and some of his friends are drinking over here tonight. Wonderful.

I feel even worse today than I did yesterday. Last night as I was trying to get to sleep, I had to breathe through my mouth because my nose was clogged up. My sore throat made it painful to swallow, so instead I just drooled. A lot. Tons, actually. My pillows were soaking this morning. I kept waking up though the course of the night with tears running down my face (what's up with that?), spit sliding down my face, and snot running down my nose. I must have been quite a sight to see. My eyelids also burned my eyes. It sucked.

So, yeah, I plan on being asleep when the festivities tonight begin. I was planning on going to the St. Patrick's Day Parade in Chicago tomorrow, but since I'll probably be dead, I may have to skip it. 

I'm not at work, obviously, and Abby is all curled up by my feet. I like the dog when she's not peeing everywhere.
