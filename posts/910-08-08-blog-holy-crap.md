So, I made these VCDs of hard to find Bruce/Sam shorts from their high school and college days. They've been selling really well. I've sold 10 now, with at least 3 more orders on the way. I've been selling them via eBay for $7 each, which I thought was a really fair price. But look what happened:

[people made the price go way, way up][1].

So, I'm thinking maybe I wasn't charging enough. I've raised my price to $15 for this next round, and we'll see what happens.
