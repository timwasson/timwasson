[The new timwasson.com is done.][1] I hate writing biographies. Now I'm working on the NES PCs shopping cart. Then I'm doing a few other junkmachine related things. Apparently th eNES PC has now been published in The Edge Magazine, which is a UK based magazine, I guess. Weird. 

My house is nearly cleaned out. We talked to a contract worker guy about doing my floors. Apparently it will be about 6 or 8 hours of sanding, followed by 5 coats of polyurethane, which will take a total of about 4 days. So, that kind of sucks. I can't start REALLY moving out for at least 4 or 5 days. Ah well.

Tomorrow is going to be a busy day.
