Well, unofficial marathon training continues. This weekend I subjected myself to a 8 mile run, which wasn't a huge stretch over the 6.5 I did the week before. The stretch was completing the run in almost the same amount of time, improving my per-mile time by 40 seconds! That's completely insane. I spent the next 2 days complaining about my sore legs, and sore feet. Perhaps I overdid it early in the training, but I have no intentions of stopping either. I've only got 3 months to prepare for this thing... no sense wasting time complaining about sore muscles. Just gotta keep on keepin' on. Starting with the official training, I'm also cutting out fast food, beer except on special occassions, and trying that 6 small meals per day thing. It'll be a rough 3 months.
