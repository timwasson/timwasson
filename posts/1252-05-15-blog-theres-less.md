There's less than a week left at my current apartment, which makes me a bit sad. I've spent the last few days packing and packing and packing some more. I've also thrown out a bunch of stuff. Lots. About 5 garbage bags full of junk that I don't even remember having or needing. While some of you who have seen my collection of junk will think that 5 bags isn't enough, I like to think it's an accomplishment. I'm one of those pack rat types who saves everything. I convince myself that when I throw something away, I'll need it the next day. 

So, I'm basically packed up and prepared for the move on Friday and Saturday. It won't be fun, but I'll manage. Then I'll be homeless for 10 days before settling in my new place.
