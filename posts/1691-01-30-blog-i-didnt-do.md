I didn't do anything last night. I got some Subway, went home, watched some TV, then dicked around on the internet for the rest of the night. That's it. So, for now, I will list the things I need to accomplish today.

1. Call insurance guy. Get insurance.  
2. Call my bank to tell them how dumb they are.  
3. Call the Art Guild to confirm my figure drawing class.  
4. Pay off my Mastercard and Discover card.  
5. Send in a student loan payment.  
6. Send in a payment for a magazine subscription I'm getting ripped off by.

That's about it. I'll do all these things from work, and then I'll feel better.
