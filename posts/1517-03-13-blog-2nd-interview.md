The 2nd interview at the video production place went better than expected. I don't think they're going to pay me enough, and I also don't think I'm too interested in the position. But, sadly, I'll probably still take it if it's offered to me. I just really need the cash, especially since my mom is probably going to be quitting her job really soon. 

I came home and worked on the comic for a while, then my dad came over to finish up this CD-ROM. No, it's still not finished, and yes, he's still adding more and more so it will never be done. Today he added 5 more sections to it. I hate this fucking CD and wish I had never started it.

Then I went jogging for the first time in a long time. I'd been using my elliptical machine the past few months, but finally it's warm enough for me to jog outside again. It was still a bit on the chilly side, but I can take it. I've been doing astoundingly well with the 'ole diet this week, despite my dad buying me a box of Fig Newtons. I love those things. Speaking of good food, pizza sounds really good to me. But I won't eat any until Monday. Monday marks 1 solid week of not straying from my diet for even a second. There will be a big party to celebrate. Everyone is invited.

So it's been about 13.5 hours since I've woken up, and I haven't really had a lot of time to sit down and not do anything. Maybe I'll take a bath, watch the Daily Show, and work some more on the comic. It's been a big day, and I didn't make a dime, either. Except for the $3 I found in a pair of pants I haven't worn for a while. Does that count?
