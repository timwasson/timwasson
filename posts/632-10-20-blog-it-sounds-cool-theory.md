Having a job where they pay me to sit here all day long. I spend my time on AOLIM, downloading songs off Napster, responding to emails, planning for the weekends, and reloading webpages every 2-4 seconds to see if something has changed. Quite a life I lead, eh? 

I've been reading up on other people's journals. It looks like a lot of people are doing the same shit I decided to do. Don't get too personal, be ambiguous, make harsh generalizations that they think will stir up some interest. It's all bullshit.

There's also a lot of people quoting song lyrics. Genius. That's genius. 

Then there's the people who bitch. "My life sucks. I have nothing to live for." Jesus, shut the fuck up. We don't care. If you think people you've never met and who happen to type about themselves in the same forum care whether you live or die, you're even more pathetic than your posts make you out to be. 

Not that I have a problem with any of this stuff. It's an open forum. You can do whatever you want, and I'll gladly ignore it.

There's more to life than this thing. There's more to life than a lot of things. I told you I'd be ambiguous, didn't I? Certain aspects of everyone's life sucks. When they dwell on them, they suck even more. Certain aspects of my life suck. Grin, bare it, drink a beer, and forget about it. 

I really wish I had more to do than post in this fucking thing today.

I won't be posting on the weekend. I have a life on the weekends. Monday-Friday, 8am-5pm I have nothing. But, I'm sure some interesting things will happen this weekend, and I'll be sure to bitch... I mean... tell you all about them when I return to hell... I mean work... on Monday. Til then, peace out. I'm gonna get outta here early today.
