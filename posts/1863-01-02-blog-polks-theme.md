Polk's theme is music lyrics. I don't think I'm a big enough music fan to quote applicable or interesting lyrics, so I'm opting to quote either my joke text messages or Maxim tip text messages. 

Maxim tip: When playing poker, fold often in early hands. The real pros fold 80% of the time.

With that out of the way, I've had an absolutely stellar couple of days. Following the party, in which I got drunk on White Russians and a tad loud and yelly, I've done nothing. Absolutely nothing. And it's been great. Tomorrow I start back on my diet and exercise and productivity schedule, so I don't feel too bad about staging my own personal movie days. I haven't even gotten out of my pajamas in 2 days.
