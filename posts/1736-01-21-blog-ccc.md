I know nothing about apetures, F-stops, shutter speeds, or ISO settings. But I didn't let that stop me. I bought myself a fancy new camera after selling my old one along with a bunch of other stuff that was cluttering up my life. Yep, I'm smack-dab in the middle of another "purging" period, which I get into about once a year.

Although, I've found as time moves along, I always have less to purge than the year before. As an adult, my goals have been to get rid of the stuff I didn't absolutely need as opposed to when I was a kid, and my only goals were to get stuff and keep it forever. It took a long time for me to get into the habit of actually throwing stuff away when I didn't need it anymore instead of throwing it in a box "just in case". Its still an urge I have to fight sometimes. I feel awful throwing away magazines, for example, but I've now come to accept that reading it just 1 time is enough for me, and I'll never open an old magazine again. 

Anyhoo, so I've been selling, selling, selling lately, and only bought 1 thing to replace all the stuff I sold. 

And I got my first paycheck from the side job I've been doing lately, and its so awesome to have that side income, even as much as it sucks to work all day, every day in front of a computer. But I'll get over it.
