My cartoon is finished! Well, sort of. I need music and sound effects, but it should be finished-finished by tomorrow. All the animation is done. It clocks in at just over 3 minutes. I'm pleased with certain parts of it, but overall, I think it's a very average cartoon. I know I can do much better, but not for the price he paid for it. 

I'll post a link once it's completely done, sound effects and all. I know you're all very curious. Okay, I know most of you couldn't care less. But still.
