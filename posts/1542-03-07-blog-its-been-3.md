It's been a busy but very productive few days for me. I'm doing this project for a guy, and the money I get from it will go straight back to the developper I paid to do my website for me. After that, the only debt I have to worry about is my credit cards, which is still pretty substantial. But I'll be getting the downpayment for a big project very soon now, and that will pay off about half of my debt. Things are looking up for me. Plus Iona hasn't paid me for a project I did about 6 weeks ago now, so I've been bugging them for my money. They promise me that it will be in my hands by next week. It will feel like free money since it's been so long since I did the project. Free money is good money.

Today I went out with Fabish for some Chinese food, went to check out some apartments I might be moving into, and have been working on this project ever since. For some reason, I feel like if I can get it finished by the end of the week, I'll immediately stop being poor and in debt, so I've been really driven to get it done. 

So, the apartment hunting was lame. I think I'm going to have to move into one of those big apartment complexes where every apartment is exactly the same, the walls are very thin, and it's just all around lame. I like my apartments to have some personality, but the complexes are cheap and readily available. Plus they all have central air, which is something I've never had while living out of my parent's house. Central air is nice.
