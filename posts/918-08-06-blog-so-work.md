So, work is going well. I'm enoying it. I get my hands cut up every single day. There's really not a lot to learn, but everything needs to be practiced. 

The new soda of the hour: Mr. Green. It's by Sobe, and it's freaking awesome. I was disappointed after Mr. Pibb turned to Pibb Xtra, but glad when Dr. Pepper came out with a very similar Red Fusion. And now comes along Mr. Green, which is even more similar to the original Mr. Pibb, except with a bad aftertaste.

In other news, I'm considering trading in the Jeep on one of those new bad ass Hyundai Tiburons. Those are sweet.
