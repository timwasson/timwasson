A gas station here in town has dropped their price dramatically down to $1.04. Amazing, no? It would be a good deal and I'd certainly go fill up, except that the line to get into the station stretches about 2 miles in all directions. The jam is right in front of the building right now, making it impossible for anyone who works here to leave. Apparently some people are waiting in line an excess of 2 hours to get gas. It's amazing what some people will do to save just a few dollars.
