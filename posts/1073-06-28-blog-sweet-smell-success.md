Can you smell it? It's in the air. The smell of success.

A couple years ago, through the magic of a bunch of hard work coupled with a little bit of luck, I knocked one out of the park with the Nintendo Computer. That little machine got me published in magazines, interviewed on the radio and TV, and got me a free trip to San Francisco to meet some of the heavy hitters of the tech world, including [Leo Laporte][1] and [Kevin Rose][2]. 

Anyway, so after all that madness, the page that I ran that hosted my project, junkmachine, became more of a pain that it was fun. I had to moderate forums, ban members, and face constant criticism about things I needed to be doing with the site. I couldn't log into my AIM anymore because I'd be attacked by a bunch of the users of the forums, or even just random "fans" would want to say hello. It was nice for a while I guess, but I'd made some mistakes with the site and the users that I couldn't reverse and didn't have the energy to deal with anymore. I decided to sell the site and pay off some credit card debt.

After selling the site, I still got a ton of email from people convinced I did the wrong thing. Most of them said I'd never have another successful project, and junkmachine was a strange fluke that would only happen once. I told them that a little luck was involved, but mostly it was hard work and I was convinced I'd do it again someday. And do it better than I'd done before. 

There's been failures along the way, sure. But I think it's pretty undeniable that Wolfie and I have hit another one right outta the park with Horror Junk. We're still definitely in the "slow start" phase, where there's a lot of work and very little payoff. But the tide is turning, things are clicking into place, and it's just a matter of time until we get the big payoff. 

Or, I guess you could say we've already gotten the big payoff. We've already gotten to meet celebrities and talk to them on camera, and hung out with a movie director and actor all night drinking beers. We got to make an appearance in a low budget horror flick about vampires in a sorority. We've been sent a bunch of free movies and gotten a small amount of fan mail. And last night, we did our first interview for a magazine.

Did I mention that junkmachine's wild success started after my site appeared in a tiny little blurb in a video game magazine? Is history repeating itself? I hope so....
