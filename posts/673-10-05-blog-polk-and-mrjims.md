Polk and MrJim's photo party was a blast and a half. I took no less than 154 pictures through out the night, which can be viewed [here][1]. My personal favorites:

[polk's conscience][2]

[planet schwa's little bizarro head][3]

[schwa has an idea][4] ('cuz of the lightbulb, get it?)

[does this look infected?][5]

[sorry dude. i have a monkey face][6]

[everyone! shut your eyes!][7]

[hang on, i have to pop a zit.][8]

["look, i can balance a record on my head!" "yes polk, truly amazing."][9]

[i have to piss, but my head is stuck to a wall.][10]

[i'm completely speechless.][11]

[either hand me a glass to pee in or a crowbar. to unstick my head from the wall.][12]

[i hate getting phone calls from dicks][13]

[simon says raise your left arm. and look at the person you have a crush on.][14]

["is that a ufo?" "dude, stop being a fag."][15]
