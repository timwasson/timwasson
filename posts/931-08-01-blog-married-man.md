Yep, I'm a married man, and I have the pictures to prove it. If you're wanting prints, buy them through Wal-Mart here:

[Trip around Vegas][1]

[Professional pictures][2] (You need the release to get these printed)

[Our Trip to LA][3]

[Horseback Ride][4]

More are probably coming, and we're on the lookout for a permanent place for all the photos but for now Wal-Mart will work fine.

Anyway, words cannot do justice to our vacation, wedding, and honeymoon combination trip. We started off the fun with a trip to the Las Vegas courthouse to get our marriage license. It was a quick in-and-out number, and 10 minutes later we were ready for marriage. Then it was time for a trip to the world's largest gift shop, followed by a trip to Fremont Street for margaritas out of novelty footballs.

Thursday a chunk of our family got in, and we saw the Cirque show Love, based on Beatles music. It was great. Friday was our "rehearsal" dinner, although in Vegas there's no rehearsal. It was just a nice dinner with friends and family who had arrived. My friends Brian and Kathleen got in very late that night, so I went to hang out with them while Hillary went to bed.&nbsp;

Saturday I fully expected to be cool as a cucumber, but I woke up in full-blown freakout mode. Fabish stopped by totally unexpectedly, but he calmed me down a little. I did get my nerves under control and the wedding went off without a hitch. Then we went on to take way too many photos, take a gondola ride at the Venetian, see the classic Vegas sign, and back to Luxor for our wedding dinner. Polk did an amazing job as best man, and the food was fantastic.

Sunday most of our family left, and Hill and I took a trip out to the desert for a horseback ride in the mountains. It was amazing, and my favorite part of the whole trip. Monday we rented a car and headed into LA to see the sights with Polk and Allison. We were only in LA for a couple hours, but saw some touristy places and that was good enough for us. Then we made our way to Anaheim to sleep and get ready for Disneyland.

Disneyland was awesome. We rode on 5 or 6 rides, wandered around and saw the sights. It was great for a day, but after a week of doing touristy things and being totally overstimulated, I think Hill and I both were eager to get away from the madness of it all and get back home. We made it back to Vegas for our flight home at around midnight, and spent some vouchers we'd collected in the casino before calling it a night around 1:30. Then it was back up and at 'em at 5 am to catch our flight home.&nbsp;

Anyway, now it's on to the married life and some degree of normalcy. And life is good.
