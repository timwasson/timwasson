I hate days like this.

I had to run out to my dad's house this morning to pick something up for our meeting tonight. Then I had to work for a few hours. Now I'm home, preparing more documents for our meeting with the mortgage broker. Then we go meet with him, fill out some papers, then go meet with the current owner of my house and fill out more papers. Thankfully, I think this is the last time we have to do this before waiting a few weeks for my loan to go through and some details to be worked out.

I just hate paperwork and filling out forms. Especially for something like a house. I feel like I'm going to mess something up. I'm just really glad I have my dad to help me along this time.
