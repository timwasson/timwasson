Last night was a good time all around. Me and Steph went to [this kid's][1] apartment to see The Saturdays play, as advertised in his journal. While there, Polk confirmed that I was right all along about his car troubles. It was not his battery, it was his starter. So there, Amy.

Anyhoo, the band was good and it was just interesting to see a concert played in that small a room. I bought their CD, but have yet to listen to it. 

After the concert, I went to meet KJ and Fabish at Gorman's, where much beer was consumed. I came home and dicked around on the internet for a while, wasting time so I wouldn't go to sleep drunk. Going to sleep drunk is a sure-fire way for me to be totally and completely hungover. Instead I'm just tired.

Today I have a lot of work to do. 

On a completely unrelated note, I can now take credit card payments over the phone or internet. If you want to pay me for something, I'm sure we can work something out.
