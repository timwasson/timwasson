So I got home last night and immediately started vegetating while watching some Forensic Files or whatever show I could find when I heard a knock on the door. It was Jen and Ben, just stopping by because they were in the area and wanted to see what I've been doing to the house, since she hadn't been there in a long time and he'd never been there. It was a nice surprise. We made plans to meet up later that night. 

I took Winnie for a ride out to Avanti's, got some grub, then more vegetating. Around 9:30, I headed to Jimmy's to wish Mullens an early happy birthday, where I met Angie and Ben and Jen. Jenny and Angie talked about nursing and patients and such while my eyes glazed over and I kept waiting for Mullens to stop getting people drinks and start doing a better job of keeping me occupied. But such is life. 

And now, I'd like to comment on terrible drivers. I admit that I am a road rager. I can't deny it. I'm a laid-back guy who doesn't let much bother him, until I start driving. At that point, everyone makes me furious. On my morning commute (I call it a commute, but it's actually about 3 miles), there's only 2 types of drivers. Overly cautious and overly dipshittish. 

I was behind an old lady in a minivan turning left. We got a green arrow. The first car went as it was supposed to, and this stupid old lady just sat in the middle of the intersection. With a green arrow. Sure, I honked, even after I noticed the wheelchair in the back, which didn't make me feel especially good about myself, but I was in a hurry. It had no effect. She waited until our green arrow disappeared and the other lane cleared before making her turn, with me stuck behind her. 

The other thing that pisses me off is people who will dart in front of you, only to stop in the right lane in front of you when you want to make a right turn. Because this crap nugget was in such a hurry to get in front of you, you're now slowed down for the duration of the stop light. If he had just merged behind you, you could have turned and he would have ended up in the same spot. In a similar vein, I hate people who bolt in front of you, cut you off, then slam on their brakes to make a turn. GET BEHIND ME, JERK. For that matter, people who bolt in front of you for any reason. Especially when no one is behind you. Like that 1 car length difference is going to make a huge enough time difference in getting where you're going to justify you being an idiot. 

Don't even get me started on 4 way stops, imaginary stop signs, and trying to get in front of everyone at a construction zone (a technique that is not only annoying and creepy, but also dangerous).

And that's my rant for today.
