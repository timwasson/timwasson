Alan and Angie came over last night to watch The Incredibles. I spent the rest of the evening setting up a computer for a near stranger.

So I'm about 2 or 3 months away from financial freedom, and I feel like those cheese ball debt consolidation commercials where people are jumping in the air, or opening mail with huge smiles on their faces before clutching the paper in a fist and screaming "yeah!" at the top of their lungs. More on that when I'm closer to landing back at "0"... first on the docket today is what to do once I'm out.

Between my consolidation loan and Discover Card payments, I've been paying off about $700 of debt per month. Come May, that money will have nowhere to go. I'm going to invest a little more on the side, but I'm also going to be in the market for a new car. My tastes are all over the spectrum at this point, from the ultra-awesome-but-completely-impractical Nissan 350Z and Mazda RX8, to practical-but-not-cool-and-bad-gas-mileage GMC Envoy to the-what-I'm-leaning-towards-today Volkswagen Passat. If I could get a Passat Diesel, I would definitely go that route. Unfortunately they only starting making Passat Diesels in 2004 and they're a bit pricey for being a somewhat boring car.

I'm keeping my Jeep forever and ever, so I'll have a 4WD SUV type vehicle for tugging and towing and bad weather, so that's not a factor in car choice. Any opinions/suggestions?
