So I went and updated my whole computer for the first time in 4 years. Yes, that beast lasted me a long time with only minor upgrades, like the DVD burner. Now I ponied up the cash for a new mobo and processor, and I got a new case while I was at it. Everything else is recycled, but it feels like a brand new system. And now I can edit video with the rest of 'em. It just hurts to go from my awesome 21" and 23" LCD monitors at work to my 19" CRT, but I think I can deal for a little while. 

Work was a pleasant break from the ordinary today as I helped get a little movie theater set up to display my directorial debut to everyone I work with. Next week is all sorts of fun "get to know your coworkers" projects, with my video kicking off the event. I'm a little nervous about it, to be honest.

Oh yeah, if anyone out there wants my old processor/motherboard for use with their current system, just ask nicely and buy me a beer or something and its yours. It should work with most peripherals out there and if I know ya, I'll help you set it up. It's not a bad little computer... a 1.4 gHz Athlon Thunderbird. Let me know, yo.

[What year was it?]

1998, when all the cool kids graduated.

[What were your three favorite bands?]

Pearl Jam, They Might be Giants, 311

[What was your favorite outfit?]

I had to wear an uniform to school. I suppose my favorite ties were either my Fantasic Four tie or the cool 70's style ones I took from my dad.

[What was up with your hair?]

Senior year was the year I stopped fighting the dress code. I cut it really short after spending the year and summer before with it nearly to my neck.

[Who were your best friends?]

I had a lot of friends. Mullens, Fabish, Creamer, Jody, Missy, John, Olsson, Brian K., The Brandon...

[What did you do after school?]

I worked at Kinko's 2 or 3 nights a week after school. The other nights I would drive friends home, hang out, or whatever else I felt like doing.

[Where did you work?]

Kinko's, baby. I still think that was my favorite job of all time.

[Did you take the bus?]

Hell no. Senior year I was back to sporting The Bluick (otherwise known as Bluey), after a short time away from her while I destroyed a Nissan.

[Who did you have a crush on?]

I don't want to admit it.

[Did you fight with your parents?]

Not really. I was pretty independent and my parents basically left me alone.

[Who did you have a CELEBRITY crush on?]

Neve Campbell and Jenny McCarthy. I still have an unhealthy crush on both.

[Did you smoke cigarettes?]

No, but I smoked the occasional cigar and really enjoyed cigarillos. Especially when sharing them with my friends not-quite-legal siblings, like Bridget and... shit... whatever Olsson's little brother's name is. Danny maybe? I never had the pleasure of treating R.Kelly.

[Did you lug all of your books around in your backpack all day because you were too nervous to find your locker?]

I had a locker right next to a hot girl in a Catholic school uniform who rarely, if ever, wore a bra. I would go to my locker as often as possible and stay as long as I could.

[Did you have a 'clique'?]

Not really. I hung out with all sorts of people. Because of Mullens, I was on good terms with the football player jock guys, but I tended to fit in better with the band nerds or the smart kids. 

[Did you have "The Max" like Zach, Kelly and Slater?]

If I did, it was probably Garner's or Town and Country Bowling. Mullens and I would hit both on a weekly basis.

[Admit it, were you popular?]

I wouldn't call myself that. As far as I know, I was pretty well liked and most people knew who I was, but I wouldn't say "popular" in the sense that I never went to a school dance and didn't get any cool awards like "best looking" or "most likely to succeed".

[Who did you want to be just like?]

I'm my own idol.

[What did you want to be when you grew up?]

By Senior year, I think I'd given up on being a comic book artist. I think I'd moved on to wanting to design webpages, multimedia projects, animation, etc. (And look at me now!)

[Where did you think you'd be at the age you are now?]

Jesus... 25 seemed so old back then. I imagine if you asked me at 18 where I would be in 7 years, I probably would have said married with kids and independently wealthy. It's amazing how as I get older, I realize its okay to hold off on getting older for a little while longer. But looking back at me at 18, it seems like a different guy. A different world. Bizarre.

I wish everyone knew me in high school. I was such an asshole. But a funny one.
