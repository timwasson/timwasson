It had been just over 6 weeks since I have taken a day off work for anything. I decided that was long enough. I took the afternoon off yesterday to go get some wood and build a little corner unit thing for Angie's kitchen. [I made some pretty good progress][1], but work stopped short when I had to go meet Polk for dinner. 

Dinner was excellent, Polk is the man, and Becky, the new waitress, seemed cool enough. I'm gonna miss these summer days, since those kinds of nights tend to not happen in any other season.
