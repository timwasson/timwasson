It's a busy day today.

First I go teach a class of 5 year olds about art. Then I go to Childers to discuss a 2nd mural for him. Then to Sully's to discuss his mural. Then to a printing place for a job interview. Then to CDSC Video for a 2nd interview. Then home to call a new contact about doing some portraits. Then I plan to sit and watch TV, because I will be tired.
