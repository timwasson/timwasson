I was just about to give January another verbal bitch slap. Last night me and Mullens were leaving Hoops. I opted to leave my coat at home, and wasn't even a little bit cold while walking to the car. I passed a guy wearing shorts. In mid-January. But today there's another blizzard, which makes me happy.

So, Hoops last night. It was the first time in a long time I got to enjoy the best pizza in the entire world for half off. 

Tonight after work, I'm getting my act together and working on my new website.
