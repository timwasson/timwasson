After getting home from work yesterday, I changed out 3 power outlets and 4 switches to complete our kitchen. One of the switches was a pain and took forever, but I got it taken care of. Then I taped and painted some more, finishing it all just in time to watch another half hour of Critters before calling it a night.

We've decided that we're going to spend a week NOT undertaking any big renovation projects after this. It really ruins your whole life when you have so much to do and so little time to do it in.
