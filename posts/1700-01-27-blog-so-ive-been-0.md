So, I've been sick. I think I almost died.

Wednesday I started feeling pretty bad. By Thursday I felt absolutely terrible. Since I always work on Thursdays, I called in and told them I'd stop by on Friday instead and take Thursday to heal. I got sort of a guilt trip, so I ended up putting in a few hours work on Friday despite feeling even worse than I did on Thursday. Saturday I felt sick too, but still went to work for about 10 minutes before deciding that I was unecessary. Today I woke up feeling pretty bad, but have gotten much better through the course of the day. Hopefully with a good night's sleep tonight, I'll wake up refreshed and good in the morning.

I dragged my bed into my living room and basically haven't left it with the exception of the few trips mentioned above. Jaimee has been taking good care of me and keeping me all doped up on Day Quil and cough drops. I've been sleeping about 12 hours per day, but never more than an hour or 2 in a row. I've had a fever, sore throat, coughs, headaches, body aches, stuffy head, runny nose, clogged ears, and have just been groggy, tired, and useless. But hopefully that's all done with and I can get on with the rest of my life starting tomorrow. 

I never really got sick as a kid, so when I'm sick as an adult I'm kind of a baby about it. I don't know what happened to me over the course of the last year or 3, but I seem to get sick much more often than I did when I was a kid. Now I sit around, moan, and feel sorry for myself. It's fun for me and everyone around me. 

Now I'm off to bed again. I've been awake for about 12 hours now. It makes sense that I'm this tired.
