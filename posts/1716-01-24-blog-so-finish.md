So, to finish the weekend I ate Avanti's and saw The Life Aquatic with Fabish. The next day I ate with my parents, moved some furniture at their house, killed some time at Alan's, then headed out about a million miles away with Brandon and Kristi for some pizza that can't compare to Hoops, although I guess it's unfair to even try to compare them. Then I went back to Alan's, watched some Simpsons and went to bed early. Overall, I'd say it was a perfect weekend.
