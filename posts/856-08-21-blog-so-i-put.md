So, I put everything I have on eBay, and it turns out that if I hit my reserve price on everything, I will have lost about $4 on this whole "buy unclaimed freight" experiment. That's not bad, though. Losing $4 is just a lesson learned, and a great lesson, really. I plan to try something similar again if I make my money back, or anywhere close to it.

Not a whole lot else to report, really. Fabish called me the other day and invited me out to Applebee's with KJ. We had all you can eat riblets, which were awesome. Fabish and I were champs, but KJ barely ate anything. Ah well, such is life.

I had to wake up really early this morning to take Jaimee to work because her car is lame, lame, lame. So, I'm tired. I'm glad it's my day off.

I have to go out to my dad's house and get his computer to recover from a vicious virus. That will be fun. Or something.
