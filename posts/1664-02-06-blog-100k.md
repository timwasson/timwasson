Well I drove the Jeep for the first time in months today, bracing myself for this snow fall we're currently in the midst of. When I turned on my defrosters, I saw a small crack spread into a large one from the top of my windshield to the bottom. I guess under normal circumstances this would piss me off, but I'm just excited I get a free windshield out of the deal. 

My windshield wipers are broken though, and that kind of sucks. And I passed the 100K mile mark on my way to work, which is great for a guy like me who is a little obsessed with palindromes. It doesn't get much better than 100,001.
