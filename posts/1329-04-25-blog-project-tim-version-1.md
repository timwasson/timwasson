I'm currently working on my first-ever PHP script that will be distributed freely over the interweb. It's also worth noting that it's my first ever PHP script written from (almost) scratch. Below is a partial list of features to be included in version .1, release date unknown.

  * fully operational moblog courtest of mafia, featuring comments. 
  * photo gallery courtest of LGR Photo gallery, featuring comments. 
  * blog with categories, comments, and LJ syndication out of the box. 
  * user registration for easier commenting. 
  * "add a page" feature, to add static pages that are easily updated via an easy web-interface. 
    Version .1 isn't too far from release. I still need to beef up security to the admin sections, as well as add commenting/editing ability to the blog entries. PHP and mySQL will be required to make this work on your own servers.
