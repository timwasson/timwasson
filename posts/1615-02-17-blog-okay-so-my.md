Okay, so, my diet hasn't been going so well. I'm doing good at skipping snacks and bringing my lunch to work, but I have very little will power when it comes to not going out when people call me. As a result, I went to Hoops last night, but managed to stop at 2 slices somehow. This morning I was at 221. 

My teeth hurt. I think my wisdom teeth are growing in. I know, I should have had them removed when I was 18 and under my dad's insurance. I don't have dental insurance anymore and Jesus, my teeth are killing me.
