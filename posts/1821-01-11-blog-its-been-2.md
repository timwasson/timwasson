It's been a pretty uninteresting couple of days all around so far. 

Yesterday Steph ditched me when we had lunch plans, so I went with Alan instead and guilted her into accompanying me to Hooters sometime this weekend. That should be fun. I've been working a lot, none of it actually billable. Which means that I haven't made a dime in over a month. That's fun, eh?

But, I have been productive in my new business, which is always a good thing. Tonight I went out to dinner with the family at some Chinese restaurant, who had the worst food I've ever had. Or maybe it's because I've become accustomed to very Americanized Chinese food at the buffets and I don't like the real deal. Well, whatever the reason, it wasn't the best meal I've ever had. 

Tonight I'm going to Sullivan's to meet Polk and whoever else ends up showing up. 

I just got done watching Bachelor Party. When I was a kid, like 13 or 14, I used to rent those cheesy 80's comedies with tons and tons of nudity in them. They even showed below the belt. Nowadays no comedies have that much nudity. The closest we get are things like American Pie and Road Trip. Oh, the good 'ole days. Anyone else miss those kinds of movies?
