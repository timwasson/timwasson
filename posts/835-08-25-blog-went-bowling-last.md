Went bowling last night for the first time in a long time. I bowled an okay 135 followed by an embarassing score that will be left out of this here journal. Then we went to Monicals.

Dayv's talk of a new car just makes me really want my own new car. It's a shame that I have another 9 months until I can even start thinking about one. Probably even more than that now that I'm back in credit card debt with my suit purchase. Maybe I should sell a bunch of stuff on eBay. Maybe tonight.
