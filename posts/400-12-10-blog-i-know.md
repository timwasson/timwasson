[<img src="http://pics.livejournal.com/wasson/pic/00009r8p" alt="121004_183026.jpeg" border="0" align="right" />][1]I know the picture is hard to make out, but it's a car upside down in the street with a fireman sweeping up glass in front of it. I know its a bit morbd to take a picture of an accident as terrible as that one, but then I thought... how often do you see a car upside down on the road? I had to preserve it.

So last night was Friday at Richards. It was good as usual.
