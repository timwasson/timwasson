I weighed in again this morning, which I haven't done for many Mondays in a row, for fear of actually gaining weight. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that I now weigh 230. I was stuck at 233 for... well, basically forever, which is really, really frustrating. But now I'm back on track. And yes, junkmachine has been updated accordingly.

225 coming next week. I can feel it in my bones.
