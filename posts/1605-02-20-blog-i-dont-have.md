I don't have a lot to update on, I guess. No big dramas anymore. And really, without drama, is my life worth reading about?

Anyhoo, last night I went car shopping with Mullens and Angie. He's looking for yet another car he can't afford. I don't know what's wrong with the kid. Everything is a competition. I get a new car, so he has to get a newer car. That's how things have always been with him. It's sickening.

So after looking at a ton of cars he can't afford, we went out to dinner. It was a really god dinner. I was in the mood for shrimp, for some reason or another. So, I had shrimp. And it was good.

Alan actually got the day off, being a holiday and all. So he was home when I got back for the first time since we've been living together, probably. We just watched some TV until I got bored and went into my room to draw and tinker with my computer. And that was my night.

Tonight I have to help my aunt with her computer, but that visit will be cut short, since Angie has some celebrating to do and has asked me to join her.
