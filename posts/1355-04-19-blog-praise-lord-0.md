Praise the Lord. Today I got my second payment for the mosquito CD-ROM, which was couldn't have come at a more perfect time. I immediately deposited the check, then came back here and made some payments on my credit cards. Good bye, half of my credit card debt. That's right. Half of my debt is paid off. I just have to keep living like a poor, poor bastard for a few more weeks, and I will be out of debt. 

With my WAP project chugging along, slow but steady, and the possible comic book job, it seems like everything's coming up Wasson. If I actually get that comic book job... well... I don't know. Something. Something good. Something good will happen.

To prepare, today I went and treated myself to a $20 gift at Dick Blick. New art supplies. I kind of convinced myself that I could use them on the comic book job, even though I don't technically have it yet.
