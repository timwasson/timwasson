Went bowling with a few buddies last night. Dodged Barb the whole time. Had a weird conversation with some girl while walking my dog. 

My computer parts are on their way to my parent's place. Brian is getting his wisdom teeth pulled today, so he will be unable to help me in setting it up. I think I can get it done on my own though... it shouldn't be too hard. I'll certainly need his help in setting up our network, since I have failed so many times in the past with that.
