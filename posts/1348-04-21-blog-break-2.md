Break in #2:

So, my Jeep was broken into last night and they stole my CD player, worth about $30. They left my digital camera, worth about $300. Smart criminals, I'll tell you what.

My back window on the Jeep was ripped to shreds, which would normall suck, except that my top is in terrible shape and this could get me a fat insurance check to buy me a new top and a new $50 CD player. I guess that's my bright side. This is the second time I've opened the door to my car and seen that someone other than me had been in it, moving things around and looking through my shit. It's a weird feeling to say the least.
