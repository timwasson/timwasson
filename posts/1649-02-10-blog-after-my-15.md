After my 15 miles on my recumbant bike and shower, I hardcore geeked out for a while working on redesigning tim.cx and working a bit on horrorjunk.com. After a few hours I went down to Jimmy's to meet Angie and Brynn. I rewarded myself for a long day of staying on my diet by consuming the worst thing I could have... a couple of beers. I managed to steer clear of the pretzels with cheese. Somehow.

224, baby.
