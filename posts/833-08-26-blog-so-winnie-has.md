So, Winnie has found a way outside of the yard. I don't know how she did it, but it's annoying. So now she's an inside dog until I figure out how she got out and how to stop it.

I wrote a follow up letter today. The first of my entire life. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think if I send a follow up, then I'm absolutely guaranteed the position. Right? Right? Right. Good. 

Anyway, I'm crazy broke and have been surviving mostly by eating stuff I was given a long time ago and don't normally enjoy eating. This includes canned fruits, frozen vegetables, soup, and washing it down with vegetable oil. Yum. I have also been drinking a lot of water, which is healthy, but I've only been doing it out of necessity and I can't wait for the time when I don't have to drink it anymore. Water blows. I'm really looking forward to Kouri's on Friday, but I may have to skip the eats and scour the couch cushions for change for beerz.
