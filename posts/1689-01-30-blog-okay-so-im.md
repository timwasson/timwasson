Okay, so I'm feeling great aside from my stuffy nose. It's annoying. It's all stuffed up so I have to breathe through my mouth all the time. Normally this isn't bad, except when I sleep my mouth gets all dried out and I have to wake up a couple times and make a weird motion with my mouth to get the spit flowin' again. I was blowing my nose in the shower this morning, as per usual, but my snot kept getting bloodier and bloodier. Eventually there was no snot left but my nose sure was bleeding. It was awesome. The water made it spread everywhere, and I bet I looked like John McClane by the end of the shower.

I called Speedcolor today regarding the job I interviewed for. No one has called me either way, which is pretty rude after 2 interviews, I think. I just left a message. We'll see what happens.

My dad called me at work today. He wanted me to call another guy about getting preapproved for a home loan. It's important because we're looking at a house on Saturday that we'll have to make an offer on VERY quickly if we decide to go ahead and get it. So by Saturday I may have a house with a kiln, and that will be cool. Keep your fingers crossed.
