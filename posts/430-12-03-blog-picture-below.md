The picture below was taken with my phone by Joshy T while I was drunk. I claim no responsibility for it.

So last night was a nice company dinner at Alexander's Steak House. It was awesome and free, and awesome because it was free. Today was lunch with Angie, Mullens, and Alan, and then was a bunch of Christmas shopping. Tonight is dinner with my boyz. 

Say hi to my new and old friend, <a href="http://sadiep.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">sadiep</a>.
