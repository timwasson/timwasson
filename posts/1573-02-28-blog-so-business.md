So the business meeting on Wednesday went well, and on Sunday I'll be spending some quality time by myself in a restaurant in the middle of the night. Hopefully the mural should be done in 1 night, but I'll probably be there until the wee hours of Monday morn. 

We went to Hoops on Wednesday. Nothing too eventful, except that's the last time we're going for a couple of weeks. Next week we're skipping it so assure that I'll fit into my tux at Fabish's wedding, and the week after, everyone but me will be in Mexico.

And last night I went to work for way too many hours considering the work I did, then went to see Daredevil with Robert. It was good, but not great, and nowhere near as good as Spiderman.
