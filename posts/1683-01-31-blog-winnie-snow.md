I just don't want to ruin my streak of YouTube videos in my posts, so I present a really worthless video of Winnie running around a snowy field. Amazing, right?&nbsp;

Life barrels on and on, things are going splendidly. I had to fire my first and only employee ever, Hillary, on account of her getting me way too much work to handle it all. I know the life of a freelancer means feast and famine, but I've been blessed this year that I have had way more feast.&nbsp;

Next month we're going to Houston to visit Hill's family, and a month later going to Gulf Shores to spend time with mine. We're very much looking forward to it.

In the meantime, we are in hard-core money-saving mode and living like hermits, barely leaving the house. I don't mind it though.
