So I went and had another meeting with the crazy ass old lady today. As I was buzzing her apartment, she walked in the front door. This is our conversation:

her: "You're early."  
me: "Well, I'm actually like 10 minutes late."  
her: "Did you already buzz the apartment?"  
me: "I tried to, yeah."  
her: "Did anyone answer?"  
me: "Uh... no. Is there someone there?"  
her: (looking at me like that was the most retarded question ever) "No. I live alone."

Oh my God. Why did she even ask if someone answered if she knew no one was there? What the fuck? It wasn't a good way to start the meeting, and the meeting didn't end well either. I really don't like her.
