[So, I didn't do so well here][1], but I did a lot better than I expected. The 4 mile race was uphill a lot of the way, and the hill wasn't what I would call "small". The race took a lot out of me, and my legs and back are hurtin' pretty bad today. I'm blaming all the hurt on the hills, since I run 4 miles a day a few times a week without this kind of hurt afterwards. 

I averaged better than 9 minute miles. Not bad considering the terrain. I wished more people had participated so I wouldn't have been so close to the back of the pack, but oh well.
