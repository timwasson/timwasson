So Earth Day was yesterday. Anyone out there do any hardcore celebrating for the holiday?

Anyway, so this weekend I took a couple of big, long walks and went running a couple times. I need to get my bicycle back into rotation and I'll be back on track to getting into as good of shape as I was last summer. Oh, and I should probably do some lifting for good measure.

So the weekend was good and productive, albeit a little less social than I would have liked. But I suppose that's to be expected.

The big day is getting closer... closing on my new house, selling my old, and the big move. It'll be a huge weight off my shoulders and really free up my schedule, hard-core. I can't wait until the day when I get off work and have absolutely nothing I could or should be doing. I wouldn't say I'm a lazy man necessarily, but I really do enjoy my "nothin'" time.
