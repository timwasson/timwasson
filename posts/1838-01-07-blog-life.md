The other blog I write for, [FreelanceFolder][1], posted a short message on their [Facebook Group][2] asking to describe the life of a freelancer in 1 word. The list they got is impressive and, I think, describes my career and my life perfectly.



> exceptional, unpredictable, exciting, flexible, Freedom, Diversity, Fun, Independence, Success, master, Strong, Crazy, Exciting, Freeing, Autonomy, Fascinating, Fulfilling, challenging, Affirming, Refreshing, Comfortable!, Rewarding, Possibility, unpredictable, Smart, Inspiring, Liberating, coffee, underappreciated, noncommuting, Chaotic, overwhelmed, perfect, Wonderful, thebestthingieverdid, Nonconformist, Worthwhile, Blessing!, Simple, Sailor, great!

Yup, that says it about perfectly I think.&nbsp;
