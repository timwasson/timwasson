So, I applied for that job as a comic book artist but didn't think I really stood a chance. They were looking for someone with an "Anime" style, like Ninja Scroll or Akira. While I'm a big fan of these movies, I've never really even tried to draw how these cartoons looked. But, regardless, I applied for the job.

He came back saying my style wasn't what he was looking for. I told him I could adapt. He asked me for a sample drawn in Ninja Scroll style. So, I drew up a couple of samples and emailed them to him. Today I got an email asking me my rates and availabilty information. Fucking awesome.

Sure, there's still not a 100% chance I have the job, but I think (hope) my chances are pretty good. The only bad part... the guy in charge is foreign and speaks in broken English. Sure, not nearly as bad as that fuckface fucker Chua Hong, but it still brings back bad memories. Will I still do the comic? Fuck yes. In his original ad, he promised a year of steady work. DRAWING. A year of me drawing for a living. Can you believe it? It's totally worth the risk. 

I should really try to not get my hopes up, but I just can't help it. I really want this job.
