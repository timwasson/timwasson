So, today was my day of many meetings.

First off, opening a business and merchant account with the help of my new friend Jackie. In the end, I got nothing accomplished. It may be more trouble than it's worth to get that set up. There's plenty of transaction services on the net who will process credit cards for me, for a small fee, of course.

Second, my meeting with my insurance man. It was about health insurance, and how I haven't had any since I've been self-employed. While there, I ran checks on how much it would cost to insure me in my next car... a BMW M3. Right now I pay $175/month for my Jeep, and an M3 would got $250. That's quite a big jump. I may have to wait a little longer until I'm a little more financially secure to buy that thing.

Third, my many phone calls to Iona. God, they're annoying me at this point. Let me finish something before giving me more to do, please.

That's about it. Tomorrow I trade some movies with Andrew, go to Iona and drop off some files, hopefully take some din-din to Polk at work, and try to clear Friday. Why, you ask? Because I'm headed up to Chi-town for a night to visit my dear friend Brian Kelly. Hopefully. If I can clear Friday.

This year New Year's will be held at Brian Kelly's house. It will be the first year in 4 years that I don't celebrate with Angie and Mullens. It's going to be a lonely holiday season... thinking about good times I've had with Steph, Mullens, and Angie... and the Christmas parties at Brice's and Bryan's. Ah, good times, good times. I think we're going to have a Christmas party here at the apartment somewhere around the 15th. That will be excellent, I think.
