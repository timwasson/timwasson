A conversation I just had with my dad:

"So, Tim, have you thought any more about that house you looked at on Central?"  
"Yeah, it's a great house... I love it."  
"It's all your mom can talk about these days. She thinks it's a great deal."  
"Yeah, it is."  
"Do you think it's too early to buy?"  
"Yeah... I won't want to move out for about 5 months. I don't think I can afford 5 months of apartment bills AND house bills."  
"Well, what if your mom and I made your house payments for you until you were ready to move in?"

So, wow... We'll have to sit down and have a nice long chat about it, and I don't know if anything will come of it, but it would be nice if it did. It's a wonderful house that I think would be perfect for me. Except that it's pink. I can live without it being pink.

I got Thirteen Ghosts playing on my DVD player, but I deemed it "unwatchable", since the audio trails the video by about 3 minutes. No good. I'll have to try other settings to see if I can make it work.
