Last night we killed mouse #7. That was a gross one. It got it's little leg stuck in the trap and was running around dragging it behind. Fabish and I had to kill it. We wrapped it in a garbage bag and smashed it with a hammer. It was really, really disgusting. We also threw the trap out since it wasn't really worth it to us to reuse it. I checked the remaining trap this morning only to find good 'ole number #8 dead. 

In a completely unrelated story, my sister's water broke last night. That's right, by the end of the day I will be an uncle. Around 1 I'm going to go to the hospital and play my Game Boy and wait for the news, but for now I'll sit quietly trying not to be too excited.
