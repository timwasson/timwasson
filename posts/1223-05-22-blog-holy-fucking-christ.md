Holy fucking Christ Almighty. Redoing hardword floors can suck my balls off. I hate it so much. Sand sand sand, noise noise noise, vibrate vibrate, faceful of dust. Crap crap, suck suck, hate hate. I hate you, hardwood floors. 

I'm not done yet. Hopefully I'll finish sanding tomorrow and put my first coat of varnish on. 24 hours later comes the 2nd coat, then the 3-6th coats applied 6 hours apart. It'll take some time. Some sucky ass mother fucking time that I don't mother fucking have. I still have to build another NES PC in enough time to UPS it to San Fran, and, of course, MOVE. I hate moving. I hate packing. I haven't even started packing. Today was the 3rd 14 hour day I've spent at the house, and tomorrow will be the 4th. This sucks. I wish I had more time.

And on top of it all, people keep calling for me to do work for them. It's great, sure, but where were they when I had time to work with them? 

My balls hurt from being shaken around by a huge belt sander all day. My poor balls. I'm going to go massage them now.
