That's the weather forecast for Peoria for the next 10 days. 9 of them say "isolated thunderstorms." At least now they're predicting temperatures above 60, although it's 58 right now, and that's lower than today's low was supposed to be. I'm losing faith in June. It should be warm and sunny right now.

Last night Brice and I went for pizza at the mall, then I picked up Close Encounters of the Third Kind. I took Brice home, then I went back to my place, tinkered around, played with Abby, and started the movie. It's an exciting life I lead.
