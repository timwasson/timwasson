I feel about 300 times better today. My dad called me to see if I wanted to go out to lunch with him, and while I was talking to him, my mom stopped by to drop off my lunch. It was a weird coincidence.

I felt like crap, but I'm not sure it was a bad enough sickness to make my parents worry so much about me. And truthfully, I think they were worried about more than just the illness. It's just that for the past few months, things have been rough for me. I always promise myself "well, it will be better once this one thing happens", but that one thing never happens. Or it half-happens and gets taken away. Either way, it's been a few bad months for me. Just when things started to get better again, I get sick. 

I've been keeping a relatively positive outlook on things through the course of it all, but I think my parents are worried that someday soon I'll admit defeat and get angry at the world or something. I never thought making myself happy would make myself this frustrated.
