So, I've been psyching myself out of thinking I got the job at Pudik. I keep thinking... if it was good, I would have heard something. So today I gave in and called, asking what the story was. The receptionist said I needed to talk to David again, who was on another call, and he'd give me a call back. So I waited. And waited. And I thought to myself that if I got the job, he would have called me back right away. At around 4, after waiting 6 hours for a call back, I finally got one.

They'd narrowed the field a bit, and I was still in the running for the position. There's 3 of us now (I was misinformed... 5 got a 2nd interview), all of which possessed different skill sets and they just needed to see who would fit into the company best. So my chances are good, but not as good as if there was only 1 candidate. I'll hear something next week.

And in the mean time, I'm working at the gallery again while Brandon recovers, which will put food in my belly and keep my lights on. Things don't suck, but they'd be a whole lot better if I got that job. So I'm feeling gooder than I have in a while. 

And I really need this job. Still.
