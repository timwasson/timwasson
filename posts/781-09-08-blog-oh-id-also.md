Oh, I'd also like to say, please to everyone on my friends list (Wolfie, this is mainly to you), stop posting those annoying LJ stupid queer things where you plug in your username and favorite color and it sends back random answers to random questions, sometimes using your LJ friends, sometimes not. If you must post these annoying-random-not-funny-or-amusing-or-even-vaguely-interesting results to random words and usernames, have the courtesy to leave it behind a cut so I won't waste precious moments of my life seeing what they say. Thank you.
