It was an alright weekend. On Friday me, Fabish, and a few of his old roommates went to a bar and drank some beer. On Saturday I didn't do much at all... just sort of sat around and watched TV. Steph came over, and me, Alan and her made some burgers, watched Dogma, and Best in Show. Sunday was even lazier... Steph came over again, and we watched Simpsons and Jackass. I also spied on the old lady in my building and got great footage for [hidethecam.com][1]. It's not posted yet though... you'll have to wait.

We played a lot of Twisted Metal Black this weekend. That's a fun game.
