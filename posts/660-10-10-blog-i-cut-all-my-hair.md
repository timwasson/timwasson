I went in to get my haircut today, and as I sat in the chair the lady asked me 2 questions.

1. It's been a while since you got your haircut, huh?  
and  
2. Who did your highlights? 

I had to laugh at the second question. I explained that I dyed my entire head many months ago and simply hadn't gotten it cut since then. I was getting really shaggy. She cut off every colored piece of hair, so I'm back to really dark brown now. It's weird walking by a mirror... it doesn't even look like me. The week or 2 after I died it blond I had the same feeling. I'm thinking of bleaching my hair this time. That would be cool. We'll see.

Not much has been happening on my end in the past few days, which would explain the recent lack of updates. Been working, yes working, quite a bit. Believe it or not, it's actually nice to pay bills again. I love being able to pay for stuff. It's such an amazing feeling after being broke for 6 weeks. 

Not all my bills are paid off and I'm out of money again, but that doesn't really matter. More money and more projects are on their way, and I'm not worried about it at all. 

I also bought a new toy. It's one of those printer/scanner/fax machine/copier combos. The best part is that I can write it off as a business expense. It's a good way to justify buying toys. I need more business expenses.
