I was walking Abby yesterday when I ran into Brandt, who I used to work with at Iona. He was a victim of the latest layoffs there. I took the oppurtunity to ask him some things that had been bothering me since I left.

First off, how many people are left at the company. When I started, I was the 53rd employee they had. They're now down to 23. That's a significant drop considering it happened in less than 2 years. 

Second, the thing with Rob being fired and blaming me. It made me feel a bit better.

And third, the thing I had heard about a possible name change for Iona. Apparently they dropped a huge, huge chuck of change on this new promotion idea. They turned "IONA" into blocks, so like the "I" was a rectangle, the "O" was a circle, and so on. They planned on sending these to clients so they could kind of play with the blocks and such. Apparently it set them back a bunch of money. Then, as they were about to send out all this stuff, someone asked if "Iona" was trademarked. They rushed to trademark their name, but found out that someone beat them to it. So, they're going to have to change their name again. They just changed it to Iona not more than 4 years ago. And all the money they put into the promotion stuff is just gone. Unless they change their name to OINA or something.

Anyway, it's a shame. I appreciate that they gave me my first real job using my degree in such, but the management there are a bunch of retards. Their current financial situation is their own fault.
