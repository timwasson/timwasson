Man. If I had it to do over again, I would have worked out with weights when I started the big weight loss program a year and a half ago. Sure, I've lost nearly 70 pounds, but damn... I notice more of a difference from the weight training over the past 6 or 7 weeks than I do with the 70 pound weight difference. I feel better, and muscles are starting to pop out where before it was just flat, or fat, skin. The only down side is that I'm hungry constantly. I mean... all the time. Starting about 10 minutes after I eat, I get crazy hungry again. Friends who work out tell me that's a sign of my metabolism speeding up and the body compensating, as well as needing more nutrients to rebuild the muscles I've tried so hard to tear down. My arms are getting lumpy, and my boobs are really close to becoming pecs. I've thought long and hard about the difference between boobs and pecs, and here's my theory:

If your boobs are lower on the outside (towards the arms) than they are in the center, they're boobs. If they're higher on the outside than in the center, they're pecs. So it is written, and so shall it be. Go in peace, my children.
