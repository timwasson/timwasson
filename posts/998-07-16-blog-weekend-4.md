So, good weekend all around this weekend. I didn't get in my meal at Kouri's&nbsp; (and won't this weekend either... maybe a mid-week trip is in order), instead opting to head to a birthday dinner at Alexander's. Some would suggest that an expensive steak dinner is a better meal than a greasy pub, but I would disagree. Give me cheeseballs, a tenderloin, hot wings, and cheap beer any day of the week. Now there's a good meal.

The rest of the weekend was nice and laid back, which is the first time in a long time I can describe one of my weekends as laid back. 

Last night, Hill and I went to see the Dancing with the Stars show. It was much less boring than I expected it to be. At one point they had local dancers get up on stage for some competition. It was easily the worst part of the show, but I'm glad they did it. It made me appreciate even more the "good" dancers who were actually... well... good and talented.&nbsp; The local dancers weren't awful, but compared to the pros... well, no comparison is necessary I guess. 

Afterwards we briefly met Joey Macintyre, which I'm sure will make my sister very jealous but no one else seems to care much. Hill also met her favorite professional dancer chick, who I didn't know before the show obviously. I'm not a fan of the TV show (and believe me, the live show does not encourage&nbsp; me to become one), but it was a good way to kill a couple hours, I guess.

And man, have I met a lot of celebrities this year! With more to come next weekend, too. 

That's right, for the second time in a month I'm way geeking out and heading up to Chicago to meet some horror movie icons and pimp out our show to anyone who will listen to me pimp it out. But mostly, this is going to be a fun convention instead of one filled with work, film, work, film. This is just a wander, talk, watch, and have fun convention. 

And it's totally strange, because the director of an anticipated horror flick is actually going to be expecting us to come up and say hello, and he's watched some of our episodes and knows friend of the show and Wrong Turn 2 director, Joe Lynch. And we've been in contact with another fan of the show who is a screen writer who knows them both. It's weird to be able to drop names and at least be peripherally connected to actual horror movie filmmakers. For the limited amount of time we've been doing this thing, we've accomplished a tremendously huge amount. I can't help but be impressed by ourselves.

And I'm not done yet, so let's make this already long post just a little longer, yeah?

I'm even happier about this convention, since it's not just going to be me and Wolfie as it's been in the past, but our awesome girlfriends are going to accompany us up to the show, wander around all the freaks in costume and anti-social types, taking part in our nerdy hobby. It feels good to be with someone who supports my hobby and is interested in things I do with my free time, even when they are kind of nerdy and traditionally "way uncool."
