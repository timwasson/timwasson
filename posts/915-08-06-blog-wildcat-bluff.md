Well, this weekend was the big garage sale. Outcome: disappointing. This was followed by the open house. Outcome: disappointing.

Otherwise the weekend was good and productive. Friday I hung out with friends at Kouri's eating delicious food and drinking delicious beers. Saturday I hung out with friends at Kelleher's drinking delicious beers. The rest of the weekend was all sorts of productive, trying to turn Horror Junk into a website people will want to visit more than once. Mission: mostly accomplished, with more good additions and improvements to come.

I've only got a few precious weeks to make Horror Junk a respectable site for the moderate amount of traffic we'll pick up from Rue Morgue Magazine. We're getting there, slowly but surely.
