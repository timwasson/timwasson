Well, not really. But it's snowing hard out there. I hate driving in the snow.

Last night I was supposed to go visit my Grandma, but the rest of my family left at 4 when I was still at work, to avoid the snow coming our way. By the time I got off there was a fresh layer of snow on the ground, not plowed at all. After the 15 miles back to my apartment, I decided I didn't want to drive the remaining 70 miles to my Grandma's house. I feel bad not seeing her on Christmas, but I hate driving in this weather and the only other people who could have driven me left before I was even off work. 

Instead I went to see Brice's new apartment, met his roommate, then went bowling with Mullens, Steph, and Angie. I told my parents to let me know the next time they visit my Grandma, and I'll do anything I can to go with. I feel bad for missing it this time, but with my tendency to fall off the road in the winter I didn't want to risk it. I know my Grandma doesn't have a lot of time left, and I'd like to see her soon.

When I was 12, I skipped my other Grandma's birthday party to go to a school dance. She died a few weeks later, and I don't really remember the last time I spent any time with her. It was very unexpected. She wasn't in perfect health or anything, but no one expected her to die so soon. Still, I felt bad, and feel bad, that I missed that. 

But on the other hand, if I had gone to my Grandma's birthday party I may have felt bad about missing the dance. You just never know.
