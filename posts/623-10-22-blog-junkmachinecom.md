So, I'm doing this webpage for a local band and was on a quest to find a good, cheap host for him to use. In the process, I found an awesome one. They even have price freeze, which means that when I sign up, that's all they'll even charge me... my rate can never go up. Since they're a new company, they're practically giving the things away. Free domain, $5/month for unlimited space and hits. So, I went ahead and signed up, thinking I may use the service in the future. Which means I own more domains than a man should own.

timwasson.com  
tim-wasson.com  
hidethecam.com  
junkmachine.com

I don't know why I picked junkmachine, really... it seemed good at the time. I don't have a clue what I'll put there, though. I'll figure something out. I wanted junkfactory.com, but it was taken.

And speaking of hidethecam.com, I need to update it. And I will. Right now. It will be up later, funny as ever.
