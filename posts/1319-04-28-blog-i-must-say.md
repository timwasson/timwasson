I must say that this has got to be the least relaxing vacation anyone has ever taken. So far I've laid down all the sod in the front, finished painting the front of the house, built a brick patio and put together a swing to go on it, ripped out some more rail road ties, and basically haven't had a chance to just take 'er nice and easy since my little vacation started.

Still, it's been nice not having to work. I've still been waking up early and trying to adjust to an earlier schedule, because Monday I have to start reporting at 7:45 every single morning. That will be rough.

Today I'm drained. I worked so hard and so long on that brick patio and today everything hurts. I imagine it's from carrying 200 bricks and 400 pounds of sand back and forth and back and forth. I think I'm just going to relax for most of the day today, but I do have some house stuff I need to take care of.

My reward for the house work: Both Brandon and Wolfie barely recognized the house while driving up to it. That makes me feel like maybe it's been worth it. Maybe.
