Hey suckers, the best cell phone company in the universe, Verizon, is hosting a contest right now called [Get Famous][1]. Basically you make a short 1-3 minute video in any format you want (sitcom, stand-up, music, drama, talk show, etc.), then send it in. Users vote on their favorite. You win, you get to produce your show for vCast, which is Verizon's streaming video application to watch short clips on cell phones. Oh yeah, and you get $25,000. 

So I really wanna do this. Anyone want to help/have good ideas?
