Well, it was a busy but good weekend. Friday was the traditional Kouri's night with the one and only <a href="http://freakwolf.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">freakwolf</a>, who I haven't seen in quite some time. We followed the drinky drinks at Kouri's with drinky drink's at <a href="http://rad_jose.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">rad_jose</a>'s pad. 

Saturday I went to Mullens' birthday party to catch up with people I haven't seen in some time. It was really fun, but when I got there, there was only like 5 people there. It was really depressing. I had made plans with <a href="http://jaimee.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">jaimee</a>, so I had to leave early. I got to hang out with Jaimee and her sister, which was fun. I had decided that after dinner, I would head back to Mullens' party. If nothing else, an extra person would make it look less lame.

So, I got back to the party, and there was plenty of people there. I guess I had nothing to worry about. I got to see people I haven't seen in a long time, and got to talk to people I've only seen in passing. Mullens was drunk and in a great mood, and thanked me over and over for coming to the party. A drunk girl kept walking around and falling on people and things. It was a good, old fashioned party. The kind I used to go to when I was underage. And really, really fun.

Me and <a href="http://freakwolf.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">freakwolf</a> headed downtown to meet <a href="http://rad_jose.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">rad_jose</a>, but he was nowhere to be found. We went to a bar where we knew some people, but it was loud and lame. I like nice, quiet bars where you can actually talk to people. This bar was not that.

Yesterday <a href="http://jaimee.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">jaimee</a> and I went to my parent's house. I had to put a new back door on my Jeep from an accident last New Year's Eve, and Jaimee's car is just a mess. My dad and I fixed her windows, changed her oil, and examined her turn signals. We had to meet <a href="http://freakwolf.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">freakwolf</a> and <a href="http://rad_jose.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">rad_jose</a> for dinner, so we didn't get a chance to fix my Jeep door.

And now it's today. I'm up way too early for myself, but I have a lot to get done today. The gallery opens at 9, so I'm heading over there for a couple hours to get some frames done. Then, my mystery packages are (hopefully) arriving today, so I need to get out to my parent's to pick them up and inspect the contents. The UPS tracking system says my tracking number (that worked yesterday) is invalid. I hope that my packages are still delivered, or I'm going to be really sad.
