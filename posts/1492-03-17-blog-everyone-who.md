To everyone who kept their fingers crossed for me, or prayed for me, or simply wished me well... thank you. I got a call for a second interview at what will possibly be the best job in the world.

Today is horror movie day. Today I get a new camera phone. Today Jaimee is making me waffles. It's a good day and everything is coming up Wasson.
