Well, last night was fun. Angie and I headed out to my parents house for our birthday celebration. My parents got me the awesomest present ever: an automatic, robotic vacuum cleaner. It rules outloud. I'm straightening my house later today so that the little vacuum can do its job properly. 

Afterwards, I went out with Fabish to do some catching up, then over to Alan's to hang out with Emily and Dave for a bit. 

Oh, but the silly thing I did happened between dinner with the parents and beers with Fabish. While at my parents house, I was drooling over my dad's awesome new cell phone. It has a 1.3 megapixel camera! Expandable memory! You can watch movies on it! Bluetooth! And it's SHINY! Well, when I got home, curiousity got the best of me and I went to eBay to see how much they were going for. I didn't actually intend to buy one, since I've spent way too much money lately anyway. But, I found one going to pretty cheap and just put in a bid. I figured I'd be instantly outbid and that would be the end of it. Well, I won the auction. I'm excited about my new phone, but also wondering what in the world possessed me to bid in the first place. Such is life... I'll sell my current phone on eBay to recoup some of the cost, and the rest I'll just win in Vegas. 

Have I mentioned I'm going to Vegas the day after tomorrow? Have I mentioned how excited I am about it?
