[how cool is this?][1]

Tonight, my dad and I installed a new outlet in my kitchen. That was fun. Now I'm going to take a bit of a break to watch The Daily Show and then I'm going to start packing for my big move, which is tomorrow, hopefully. I don't plan on getting all the way out, but hopefully I'll only have 1 more truckload before I'm ready to be done with this awful apartment.
