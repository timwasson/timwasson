Note to self: It's a really terrible idea to eat an entire cheesecake by yourself just because a couple people say there's no way you can do it. If you do choose to accept such a challenge, expect to find yourself sick to the stomach for several hours following the cheesecake consumption. This sick feeling will subside when you wake up in the middle of the night, stumble to the bathroom, and proceed to vomit your guts out in the most disgusting way you can ever possibly imagine. Ever.
