I didn't want to go out tonight, but a bunch of other people did. With it being July 4th and all, I knew there would be a lot of cops out, so I decided to be the designated dumbass once again. I'm such a good friend. I hung out with a bunch of drunk people at Old Chicago all night, then drove them to SOPs. There was another sober girl there, leaving me the perfect chance to get the fuck home and to bed. I'm still up waiting for Alan to tell me I can definitely not worry about driving them home, at which point I will fall asleep faster than I ever thought possible. Otherwise, I have to sit awake until 4 AM then pick them up. I think the weather and my decision to not turn on my AC is making me tired all the time.
