Mom: "Tim, how would you feel about being Jack's Godfather?"  
Tim: "Oh no, they're not going to ask me, are they?"  
Mom: "Why? Don't you want to be?"  
Tim: "No, I don't. I hope they don't ask me. I'd have to say no."  
Mom: "Why would you say no?"  
Tim: "Well, I don't think I'd be a good role model for a child whose parents are trying to raise him religiously."  
Mom: "Why do you say that?"  
Tim: "I think all organized religion is pointless, and I have big problems with Catholicism. Since they're probably going to raise him Catholic, I wouldn't be good for the job."  
Mom: "Oh. Well, I was just asking because I think they're going to ask Brian Jenn to be his Godfather."  
Tim: "Oh, good."  
Mom: "You don't care?"  
Tim: "I'm really happy about the decision."  
Mom: "Okay. You're still his uncle, and you're still in his life."  
Tim: "Yeah, it's fine. I didn't want to be his Godfather."  
Mom: "Okay. I just wanted you to know that you can still participate in raising him."  
Tim: "Mom, I know. I don't care."

Apparently everyone in my family was concerned with how I'd take the news that I will not be my nephew's Godfather. I really couldn't care less. I'm relieved, actually.

I've spent the last few days helping my dad set up a new office in the house and trying to find ways to make some quick cash. I just went over the limit on one of my credit cards and they're charging me a penalty for it. Fuck. I did not need that.

I may have to do something involving porn to make some quick cash.
