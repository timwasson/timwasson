Fantastic night last night, I tell you what. We stopped briefly at Johnny Vig's, who didn't have food. Polk and I downed 5 PBRs real quick and we headed to Nick and Willy's. After Brandon and Kristi went their separate way, Polk and I went out to get some pie. I also got some clam chowder. Then I won a monkey out of one of those crane games in the lobby, knowing that Brandon would have been extremely jealous, not only of my skills at the crane game, but also at the fact that I got a monkey.

We stopped by Borders for a few brief moments before calling it a night. Good times. Tonight I think I'm having a couple beers with Fabish.
