I'm back at work after another good weekend. Work sucks. I hate being here. I hate it when I don't have anything to do, but then when I have things to do, I hate that too. Ah well. 

This weekend was really good. Friday after work I had to take care of Abby and get everything packed up to go visit Jaimee. I didn't get there until around 8, at which point we just killed time before going to DeKalb. I met her sister, her sister's boyfriend, and went to a local bar. It was kind of loud and there were no open tables, but it was still a good time, and Jaimee's first legal bar experience. I was glad to be there to witness it.

I left kind of early on Saturday because I didn't trust Alan with Abby. With good reason, I think. There were 3 new stains on the carpet, and Alan explained to me that there were several more in rooms I hadn't checked. The problem is that Alan and his girlfriend say "Good dog" and pet her right after she pees on the carpet. That's not how you do things. 

Anyway, me, Mullens, and Angie went out to eat and they were moaning about stupid things I didn't care about. There was yelling and tension and anything else you can imagine. They wanted to go to bar, but I didn't want to hang out with them anymore. Still, I went for an hour or 2, but talked mostly to Fabish and KJ who showed up later. I left at around 11 and went home to go to sleep. 

Sunday was so productive. I wanted to do some laundry but didn't get around to it. However, I did install a door bell, fix the latch on our bathroom door, tighten the door knob on our front door, hang up some posters, clean the toilet (I even bought some of those 2000 Flushes things), and cleaned up some of Abby's messes with this new carpet shampoo, which worked much better than the other stuff I had which left the carpet messier than it was before. I also did the dishes, cleaned the kitchen, and vacuumed. 

Mullens and Angie came by later and accused me of being grumpy the night before, then made dinner and left my kitchen in a horrible state. We watched "Meet the Parents" because Simpsons wasn't on. I checked the schedule on my digital cable thing, and it said Jackass wasn't on either, so we just watched Meet the Parents all the way through 9. It ended at about 9:20, so I shut it off and turned on the cable when what did I see but the end of Jackass. How upsetting for me. I'll have to catch it in reruns.
