So I don't forget:

2nd Interview at Pudik Graphics, September 10th, at 10:30 AM with David Smit and several others. 

Yeah, they just called, which is freaking awesome, awesome, awesome. David told me that I wouldn't hear about a 2nd interview until Tuesday or Wednesday, after the owner of the company got back from vacation. I don't know if it's a good thing or not that the scheduling is premature, but I'm going to assume it's good. 

I'm excited. Financial freedom, here I come! Hopefully. And if nothing else, it's validating to get a 2nd interview with some pretty harsh competition. I don't imagine there's more than 6 or 7 2nd interviews out of a batch of 80 resumes, so I'm feeling fine. I'll feel even finer if I get the job.
