Last night was the 20th, which meant 20% off everything at Hooters. Me and Alan went and ate a lot of wings (a LOT of wings). Then we went to Hoops and met up with Angie, Brynn, Carissa, and some guy. I don't know his name, but he had stupid hair.

Today, in less than an hour, is my job interview. I actually interview pretty good, so I'm not too worried about it. But, send your good luck wishes and/or prayers my way, because I really need a job.
