So, I'm in good 'ole St. Louis as a boring ass car show right now, and I will be until Friday. And it sucks. And it's boring. Did I mention that it sucks and that it's boring? Because it sucks. And it's boring.

I'm selling those CDs I've been working on with my dad for forever now, and they're selling at a less than stellar rate. So far, 10 down, and 40 to go until we reach our goal. Will we reach it? No. 

Anyhoo, I'm bored and this place sucks my ass off. I can't wait to be home.
