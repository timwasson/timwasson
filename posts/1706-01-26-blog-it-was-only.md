It was only a matter of time before the almighty Cecil tackled the question, and [here's the answer][1]. Remember, it doesn't matter WHY I was right, it only matters that I was completely right and those who disagreed are silly. 

With that out of the way, I had a great night last night. I bowled a 143 and 148, even after taking a few months off from the game. The bowling was after dinner, which I enjoyed with John and Mullens. It was also before Jimmy's, which I enjoyed with Mullens and Angie.

A few matters of local interest: If you're in the mood for something "you don't see everyday", then head down to the river, particularly that gazebo in Liberty Park. Because of the river rising, the gazebo is flooded and frozen, like a strange ice skating rink. If you walk towards Old Chicago, there's more flooding/frozeness which begs to be skated on. Better hurry though, since when I walked by it looked as if they were in the middle of a cleaning effort.

And finally, there was a school shooting at Woodruff today. It looks like no one is safe from teenagers with guns anymore.
