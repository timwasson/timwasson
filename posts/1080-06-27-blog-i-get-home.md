I get home from work last night and Alan and I install a new 220 volt plug in the basement for my dryer. After that, we picked up sticks and garbage that the storm had blown into the yard. Then we mowed and weedwacked, and then we went to the grocery store to pick up food for our barbeque. About halfway through the mowing, I realized that Alan is my new boyfriend. Or at least that's what the neighbors must assume.

The cook out was me, Alan, Mullens, Brynn, and Carissa. They went to Crusens, I didn't. I had to be up at 7 this morning. I was supposed to be at my parents' house at 8, but I'm not gonna make it.
