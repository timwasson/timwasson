So, I semi-officially weighed in at 200 the other day, which is a loss of a ridiculous 50 pounds in the last 7 months. To celebrate, Jaimee and I went out with a group of people to Hoops. I ate too much pizza and drank too much beer, but had a good time. This was followed by dinner at Hooters the next day, where I ate too much fried food, and the first french fries I'd had in a long, long time. As a result, I suspect that I'm back over 200, but scared to step on the scale again for the next few days.

Nothing else happening, I guess.
