I slept for about 13 hours straight last night, which was excellent. I feel much better today. 

My parent's shower is probably the most excellent thing in the world. It's very high pressure, and there's always hot water. And the shower head is high enough that I can put my whole head under it without bending into a weird shape. 

The futon is slightly less comfortable. I have to sleep diagonally to fit correctly. It will work for 2 weeks, I guess.
