I thought of it. I was going to mention the Perl class I signed up for. I've been learning a lot about website back ends and databases and the like, and been downloading, viewing, and modifying scripts for my own use. Now I'll learn how to write them. 

The only thing that sucks is that it's 5 whole days, from 8-5. It starts March 18th and goes that entire week. I'm looking forward to having a reason to wake up and a reason to leave the house. Unfortunately I'll lose an entire week when I could be working or looking for jobs. But hopefully this Perl stuff will keep me from blowing money on another website with a huge back end, so I can still money making sites without dropping 5 Gs on it. 

Anyway, that's boring now that I figured it out. And now I'm back to work on this other project.
