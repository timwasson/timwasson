So Jaimee has a new beau. I'm not happy about it, but I guess I appreciate that she told me before posting about it or letting me hear about it through a third party.

I'm slightly more upset about it than I probably should be, but I'll get over it. Until I do, she's been removed from my friends list. It's not malicious or petty or anything... I just really need to practice avoidance in times like these. She didn't understand that as well as I had hoped. 

Anyway, that has been the bummer of my week.
