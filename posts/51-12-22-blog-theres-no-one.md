There's no one in the office today. Everyone took the day off. I can't because I wasted my days off for when I had hangovers.

They may let us go at noon today, not that I'll get to leave. I have to stick around for a meeting this afternoon. That one meeting will be the only thing I do all week, and it's the one thing keeping me here into my Christmas break.

Stupid job.
