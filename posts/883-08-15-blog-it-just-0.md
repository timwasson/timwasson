Is it just me, or are weekends getting shorter? I'm sure the feeling has something to do with sunset coming a bit sooner than it has for a while, and its a tad darker when I wake up in the morning. Summer is on its way out, which really disappoints me. Except for my air conditioner pooping out a few weeks ago, this has been one fantastic season. I'm sad to see it go. 

Anyway, this weekend. At some point last week, maybe on Thursday, Angie and I saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I thought it was fantastic. On Friday we didn't go to Kouri's for some reason I still can't wrap my head around, but tried to go to Schooner's. When it was too crowded to get a table, I recommended Kouri's again but was shot down. We ended up walking in the rain to Crusen's, where we had good food but shitty service. And I was happy Dayv and Alan were there to make me feel slightly less 5th-wheelish. Afterwards I just went home and sat around. 

Saturday I didn't feel like being productive, so I wasted a few hours in the morning watching Cube Zero, which was just fantastic. Cube ruled out loud, but HyperCube was an embarrassing disappointment of a crap movie. Barely watchable. Cube Zero had me until the ending, which sucked. I'd planned on doing some woodworking, but the rain put a stop to my plans, as the only good place for me to do my wood stuff is outside on my driveway. I mostly just watched TV all day. That night, Angie and I went to Old Settler's Days in Brimfield, sticking it out in the beer tent most of the night. 

Last night was my sister's birthday party, so Angie and I headed out to my parents' house for a cookout and cake. After a short trip to Wal-Mart, we went our separate ways and I called it a night. And today is pay day, which rules.
