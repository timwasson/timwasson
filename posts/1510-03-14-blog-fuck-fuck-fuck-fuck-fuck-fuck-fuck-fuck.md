So, I'm a bit pissed off. The guy I was doing the webpage for refuses to pay me for services rendered. I have been more than reasonable throughout the course of the project, doing things above and beyond what was required of me, and he fucking turned me around, bent me over, and put his penis directly in my asshole. I could not be more pissed off at him right now.

Since he paid me the deposit via PayPal, he's going to do whatever he can to get it back. Which will mean I lost more than a week of work I could have spent on other projects. FUCK.

I'm calling my dad's lawyer tomorrow to see if he can help me in getting my $1,000 out of this fucking shitfuck fucker, but since he lives in another state, it may just be cheaper to let it slide than get my money. Maybe I'll call Judge Judy if that's the case. She'll hook me up.

Plus the Perl class I was so excited about has been cancelled. FUCK. This has been a bad few months for me.
