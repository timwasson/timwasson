Well, I was just informed by 2 people that some animation jobs I had lined up will be at least delayed, if not cancelled.

Sweet Jesus, give me something to do.

So... big plans for tonight... A friend is having some people over to drink beer. I will be one of them, and I will drink beer. The plan is to drive out to Bartonville, which is a small town right outside Peoria. They have an old sanitarium there, so we're going to sneak in and wander about. Tonight is the perfect night for it, I think. The only bad thing is that I'll have to spend the majority of the night with this guy I hate. Ah well. I'm over it I guess.

That's it for now. I'm outtie early. It's a special night. Happy Halloween everyone.
