Yeah, so, I kind of have a social life again. And it's with Mullens and Angie, the people who I would have suspected the last people to be friends with if you asked me 6 months ago. We had a falling out, but I've had time to come to terms with the whole situation. So, on Monday, Mullens called me from the bar he works at, complaining that there were no customers and he was bored. I went down for a few drinks. For a while, I was just sitting by myself at the bar like a lonely drunk, but Angie and Mullens' sister Steph came in, so I had some company later on. On Tuesday, Angie invited me to have drinks with Fuller to celebrate his birthday. I never really had a falling out with Fuller, but we don't get along anymore. We just sort of went our seperate ways, I guess. He hasn't really changed since we were 14, so the people that HAVE matured don't really want to spend time with him anymore. But it was nice to catch up with him for the first time in like 8 or 9 months.

On Wednesday, I was invited down to Hoops, but politely declined. I'm an old man and can't go out drinking every night anymore.
