Fabish called me into his room just a couple of minutes ago, all excited to show me something. I walked in and he showed me his computer screen, and he had just opened up Morpheus. He wanted to show me the banner ad at the top of the opening screen. [www.funnyprizes.com][1]... the site I did all those illustrations for. The ad contained about 6 of my drawings.

I know it's silly, and I know that no one in the world other than me and like 10 other people will see that banner and think "wow, Tim did that!", but it's still an amazing feeling to have people look at what I've drawn. I only wish I was more happy with the quality, not to mention the content, of the pictures. But either way, it was a big deal to me.
