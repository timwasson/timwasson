The plan is to finish my kitchen this weekend. Man, that will be awesome. I haven't had a finished kitchen in about 3 months or longer. Not only not finished, but not even remotely close.

I guess as a single guy, I don't use the kitchen a lot anyway. But I did "make" dinner a couple times a week... usually just a Lean Cuisine with apple sauce or cottage cheese or something like that, but without a counter or dishes or a sink, even those plans are out the window. It may be a cop-out, but I consider my lack of kitchen and constant eating out part of the problem I've had dropping weight this year when it usually isn't a big deal. 

But hey, speaking of dropping the weight, I did what I said I was going to do and kick my work-out schedule up a notch with the sale of my old house. What's the saying... 3 weeks until habit? Well, I'm starting my 3rd week of waking up super early and going running/walking. I'm slowly but surely working my mileage back up and getting slightly faster. Once I start hitting 4 miles every morning, the weight should start dropping like it usually does at the beginning of the summer.

It's still a hassle waking up so early, but I love getting my exercise out of the way first thing in the morning. Consistency has always had to be a part of my work-out, and this is the only way for me to be consistent anymore. So I'm already feeling better and am getting used to this schedule.

This winter I'm building a bar in my house. It's going to be awesome.
