What's going on with my LJ friends these days? No one is updating anymore. Not even me, I guess. 

Yesterday I had to go out to my parents house to help my dad install one of those new antennas, since he has a satellite and doesn't get local stations. So I climbed onto the roof while it was half frozen and snowing, risking my life so my mom could get 4 more stations. Not that I'm complaining.

Since I'm too broke to buy anyone Christmas presents this year, I've decided to make everyone something. I've started most of the projects now. Between my family's projects and a couple of portraits I have to do, I'm going to be pretty busy between now and then, even on my days off.
