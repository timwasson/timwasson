Yeah, so I'm bored enough to ramble now. I'm going to ramble about something I'm fairly excited about right now.

So, for a while, I had planned on leaving the state in early September. Then I got the news that I'll be an uncle soon, so I decided to stick it out here until January. Well, not even a week later, we had an all employee meeting at my company.

Since I've worked here, we've had exactly 0 profiting months. None. Not even one. So, after a year of the company losing money, they've decided to take some considerable action. 

They presented us with 2 options. 

1. Work at home. If they get enough production people to work at home, they can move into a smaller building. That means less rent for them. For me, it means I make my own hours, and I don't have to come into the office every day. The bad part is that I'd have to get a new computer for home. I just bought a new computer 3 or 4 months ago, but it was kind of a low priced, crappy one. I just bought it for email and webpages, since I have this monster machine here at work and I didn't need anything fancy. Well, I would need a fancy computer. They'd supply me with all the software I need, but the computer would probably set me back at least $2000. 

2. Free Agent. This would be amazing. I would no longer be an employee here. For jobs that came in where they needed a 3D or Flash animator, they'd call me and we'd negotiate price. This is an awesome deal, since right now they pay me about $16/hour. If I were to go free agent, I could ask about $60-80 an hour. Of course, I wouldn't be working 40 hours a week. I'd be lucky to work 15 or 20 hours a week, even if I sold my services to other companies. Plus I wouldn't have any insurance, so I'd have to pay health and dental insurance myself. And taxes. Plus I'd still need that monster computer, and I would have to buy my own software. That would mean an initial investment of like $10 grand. That's a lot of money, but if I got it, that's an exciting prospect. My own hours, my own vacation, sleep in every day, work when I want to work... damn.

This came at a good time, when my discontent moods come more and more often. I feel like I'm wasting myself, trying to be a 9-5 business man, when I am certainly not a 9-5 business man. But things will get better, hopefully soon. My 1 year evaluation is coming up soon, and I'll be discussing all these points with them. We'll see how that turns out.
