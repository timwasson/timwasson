I went down to Richards with Polk and Brandon last night. On our way out, I said to Polk that he would be making a stop at Circuit City with me, since I had driven him and all. He gave me the weirdest look I'd ever seen from him before fessing that he was about to ask me if I could stop there for him. We're on the same page, me and that kid.

I managed to go to Circuit City, look at gadgets and DVDs, and not buy anything. Can you believe it?

No quote today because I'm lazy.
