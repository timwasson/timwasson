So I applied to work at Circuit City yesterday. I had forgotten how long and stupid those trivial job applications are. Honestly, I could take or leave the job. I don't care. It's just a way to get out of the apartment sometimes. I had to fill out a huge application and when that was over, I had to fill out this 100 question questionaire. I vaguely remember doing that for Kinko's, followed by a series of 4 interviews, only to be shot down. A few weeks later, they called back saying nevermind, I had the job. It's liberating just being able to say "Fuck it, I don't need the job", although, truth be told, I could really use the cash right about now. Or a week ago. Whichever.

Nothing else much is going on, though. A lot of half-work, I guess. It's hard to be motivated as days get longer and I'm still not getting paid. I make a lot of phone calls and work on personal stuff that will hopefully get me work. I bid on a lot of jobs. Nothing solid yet, although I was promised a job but have only gotten one email from him and nothing since. I need to spend one of these days just responding to everyone who sent me an email but I never heard from again. I think they owe me at least a rejection if that's what's going to happen.

Ah well. Back to work, I guess.
