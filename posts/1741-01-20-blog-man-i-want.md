Man I want [this car][1]. 

Well, the last few days have been uneventful as per usual. I'm fast approaching some financially trying days, so I've been doing what I can to spend absolutely no money. That means no food and no fun. Hopefully by the end of the week my money problems will be solved, but I'm certainly not betting on it. 

My parents have been taking me out to eat a lot since they know I can't afford it alone anymore. We've visited little Jack a couple more times, and he spends his days crying like the little baby he is. Thursday we went to Pizza Uno, Friday night Avanti's, and today Red Lobster. Last night Mullens stopped by and he bought Pizza Hut for us. That's 4 free meals in 4 days. Not too shabby.

The webpage is all progress progress progress, and coming along quite nicely if I do say so myself. I was hoping it would be finished by today, but the programmer feel behind, so no such luck. 

Rent is due today. That sucks. I didn't need that right now.
