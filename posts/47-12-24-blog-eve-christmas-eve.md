So, I bought my sister and Robert a DVD player for Christmas, only to find out later that Robert had gotten a DVD player for Sarah. So, I don't know what they're going to do with the one I'm giving them, but hopefully they'll figure something out. On a related note, I bought my dad these new shop lights that he wanted, only to find out later that he had bought the same exact lights a couple days ago. I don't really care. I'm just going to give them the presents I had originally planned on with a reciept and they can do whatever they want with them.

Tomorrow night I'm going to a Christmas Eve church service, as is the tradition with us, then I have nothing planned. On Christmas we're opening presents at my parent's house, then I have nothing planned. For the last few years, Christmas night was spent in drunken glory with Steph, Angie, and Mullens. Maybe this year it will just be me and Steph, or me Steph and Fabish, or whatever. Or maybe it will be nothing. Whatever.

That's about it on my end these days. My dad told me one of my Christmas presents: Jurassic Park 3 on DVD. That's the only thing I know for sure I'm getting.
