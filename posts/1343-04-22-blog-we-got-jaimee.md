We got Jaimee a laptop, and today I took it upon myself to set up a wireless network in the house. So we can surf all wirelessly and cool-like. Yeah, I'm probably jumping the gun by spending money I don't have, but my gadget addiction hasn't been fed for a while and since I'll be starting a well paying job soon, I don't feel too bad about it. But this laptop is the last purchase I'll make until my credit cards are paid off. I mean it this time. But after my credit cards... here I come, PowerBook.

In the meantime, I'm looking to sell my 21" monitor and my scanner/printer/copier. Both are big and heavy and I'd rather not put them on eBay because of those facts. Any locals want to make me an offer on either of them before I post in the Peoria community? Let me know, yo.
