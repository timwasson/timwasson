Yep, that time of year again. Time to look at your life, decide what needs to improve, and make those resolutions to get back on track. Normally I'd go through my business/freelancing resolutions, but [the article at FreelanceFolder][1] covers them pretty well I think. &nbsp;

So, on a more personal level, I'd like to keep it short and sweet: Drop a few pounds, move to London for a year, and be more creative and productive overall. Oh, and draw more, and get a few paying gigs as a freelance illustrator.
