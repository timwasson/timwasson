I was really, really tired all day yesterday. I went to bed at around 10, which means I was awake just over 12 hours before sleeping another 10. Hopefully that's out of my system and I can start sleeping like a normal man again.

In other news, my legs, ass, and arms are killing me. I'm guessing from my work out, but it was no different than it is every night. I don't know what happened there. And speaking of my work out, it's been 5 days since I haven't veered off course with the diet, and 5 days since I've been working out extra hard in the evenings to drop the weight I gained during the 2 days of livin' it up at the wedding. The result: I've lost exactly nothing. I give myself until Monday to lose at least a pound, and after that, this is officially a plateau.
