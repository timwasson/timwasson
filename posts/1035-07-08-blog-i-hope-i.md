I hope I get adjusted to this schedule sometime soon. 2 and a half months in, and I'm still sleepy all the time and have a hard time getting out of bed in the morning. 

The freelance project is finished until I get some more revisions, so my time until then is reserved for Optimus. 

My life is boring.

I want a PowerBook.

I'm going to go jogging and skip dinner tonight. And work on Optimus.
