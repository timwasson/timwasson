Happy Thanksgiving, everyone, even if you get this a little late.

I had a good one... I ended up buying a Game Boy Advance, although I'm not sure how smart a purchase that was. We drove 4 hours to Missouri to my aunt and uncle's new cabin there... it sits on 3,400 acres. Can you believe that? 3,400. There's 5 old, run down houses on their property. They took us on a tour of some of the highlights of this place, and on our way to one we found an old car... a '50 Oldsmobile. On the side of it, in stainless steel, it had a badge that said "Futuramic". I thought it was the coolest thing ever, so I ripped it off and took it home. 

I had to sleep in their guest bed, which was puny... the kind of bed I slept in at age 12. I kept waking up in the night because I would toss and turn and ram my elbows into the wall.

Dinner was good... it was me, my parents, my aunt, uncle, 3 cousins, and John's girlfriend. They have so much money and so many cool things that it's unbelievable.

On the ride home tonight, I got a call from Molly, telling me it was Steph's last night in town. Originally she was going to stay until Sunday night. So, they were going to go to Perkins and they invited me. 45 minutes I was there, and we bitched and moaned about some things and joked around about others. Fun stuff.

So now here I am... good news, I finally got my license plates. I ordered them in January. They were supposed to be personalized, but instead are just generic. I'm a little pissed, but I guess I'm over it. At least I have them now.

I also got some dating service thing in the mail. Weird.
