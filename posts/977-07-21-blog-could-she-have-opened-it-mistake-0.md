I'll tell ya what. This heat is friggin' miserable. Last night I made it just over 2 miles before having to stop. Its a far cry from when it was 15 degrees cooler and I could do 6 and 7 miles without having to push myself too incredibly hard. 

After the jog, Angie made me a nice, healthy dinner and we watched some cheesy reality TV. It was pretty much a fantastic night. Tonight is poker night, where I fully intend to walk away the winner again.
