I forgot to give you that great update of what I did last night. I know you all missed it, but fear not, because here it is.

I went back to my parent's house last night, as you know. We had homemade pizza, which was remarkably gross. I could have ordered it from Papa John's for $8.99 for a large and it would have been the best pizza on earth. Why would anyone make pizza when great, cheap pizza is so readily available? Ah, but I digress.

Dinner was okay. My parents and my sister talked about stupid stuff like they always do, completely excluding me from the conversation. I used my dad's computer to look for Jeeps on the internet, and after a while he came back and looked with me. We didn't find any exceptional deals, but I'm really looking forward to buying one. 

I left at about 7:30 and went back to my place. I returned a couple of calls, one to my future roommate, letting him know everything was set for him to move it, except I have to make an extra key soon. Everyone was busy, tired, or sick, so I was just going to watch one of my new DVDs and go to sleep. But, Steph called and wanted to come watch one, and I wanted to have her come watch one, so I waited.

I went to sleep earlier than usual, but I'm still dead tired.

Tonight we're going to Damen's. I don't know what else we're doing, but I really want to see Dracula 2000.
