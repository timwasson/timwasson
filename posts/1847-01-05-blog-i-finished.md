I finished up my sister's nursery walls yesterday, so it's nice to have that off my list of things to do.

Last night I went out with [this kid<a>, <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/aimer79">this kid<a>, and <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/charlieweewax">this kid<a>, Essay Bee, Forrest, Sarah, some girl who I can't remember her name, and later Jeannine and some other girl I can't remember ner name stopped in to say hi. It was good fun.</a></a></a></a></a>][1]

I've now read 2 different LJ entries describing vaguely the details of last night, and neither of them mentioned Mr. Bryan J. Polk's unfortunate car situation. My theory remains that his starter is bad and not necessarily his battery, but time will tell on that. In any case, his car wouldn't start and we wasted a good 3 or 4 hours standing out there in the freezing cold trying to get the thing moving. Cops passed us by and simply waved rather than actually helping (God forbid), and Amy took the credit for the car starting for reasons still beyond my realm of understanding.

And that's about it... tonight I really want to see The Royal Tenenbaums, and I'd also like to go bowling with Angie and crew. We'll see how good I am about squeezing both of those in today.
