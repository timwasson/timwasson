I'm not sure if I've just killed my tastebuds with meal after meal of Lean Cuisine, or if the dinner I had last night was as perfect as it seemed to be, but Jesus... Lean Cuisine turkey bites with mashed potatoes and gravy is like heaven on a little plastic tray. It was easily the best dinner I've ever made in less than 5 minutes. 

Not much else happening. This weekend I went out with my boyz on Friday, changed my oil on Saturday, and did nothing else of any importance for the remaining days. 

My only exposure to new music/music videos these days about 15 minutes in the morning that I flip between MTV2 and VH1. This morning I caught Gwen Stefani singing about rich girls. Am I the only one who thinks Gwen should make a new music video every week, but should stay away from making music? Everything from her post-Tragic Kingdom has hurt my ears, but she's oh-so-pleasant on the eyes. "I'd have all the money in the world if I was a wealthy girl"? That doesn't even make sense! Just wiggle around with your abs showing, maybe sing some of your older songs, and stop trying to write new ones. And that's that.

Also, I feel its important to note that Gwen and I share a birthday.
