AKA - Goodbye, credit card debt.

Well, not quite goodbye, I guess. But close, and that's what matters. I'm down to about $400, but keep buying stupid stuff I shouldn't be buying. I can justify the purchases now since I'm so close to being debt free, but I should still cut back a bit.

Today I bought Winnie a new leash, bought myself a new toothbrush, and finally made my way to the post office to fill out the change of address forms. I also stopped by my new apartment building to introduce my dog to the necessary people and make sure I was still on track to move in on June 1st.

I found my Berni Wrightson book while searching through all my old junk last night. I'd missed that book.
