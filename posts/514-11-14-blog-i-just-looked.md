I just looked at the date. I lose track of the days sometimes... Jerry from Iona called me today to schedule a meeting for Thursday, and I swear, I thought that TODAY was Thursday. Weekends have lost their meaning for me since I never really go out anymore, and when I do, it's usually on a Thursday. I work pretty consistently on time I shouldn't be working just to keep my mind off things, and prepare for the future, as I always tend to do for some reason. I suppose I should live in the present instead, and I do for short periods at a time. I just don't keep it up for some reason or another... I don't know why not.

I'm overly cautious sometimes, I guess.

But anyway, back to the real reason I noticed the date... it's the 14th, which means that my good buddy [Mr. Bryan J. Wolford][1] will be back in town for Turkey Day or something so I'll get to hang out with someone new and see a new face and have a new conversation for the first time in a long time. Maybe we can even schedule a meeting with [Mr. Bryan J. Polk][2], even though I just saw him at the lame party.

I am getting very, very tempted to shave my head again. This hair stuff is for chumps.
