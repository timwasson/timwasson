I was suspicious, and with good reason. They wanted me to sell air purifiers or some such thing. It was a crock. I feel like a chump for even going. Ah well, live and learn.

On the other hand, my other interview today went great. I'm pretty sure I'm a shoe in for the position. It's definitely not what I would love to do, but it's money. I'm not exactly sure how much I'll make, although I can pretty much guarantee it's not as much as I made at Iona. Between that job and the gallery, I may be doing okay, but it will be long, long days. I have a second interview with them tomorrow. I'd basically be doing the same thing I did at Kinko's, minus the customers, plus a little more design thrown in. Plus I was already told today that there would be a lot of down time. I love me my down time.
