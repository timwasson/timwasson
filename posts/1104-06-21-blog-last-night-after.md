Last night, after working for 8 hours on my computer at work, I went home and worked for 3 more on my computer at home. Fun stuff. But, I got a lot of stuff done on [hidethecam.com][1], so that's a good thing. Me and Brice went to eat at Pizza Hut, and later in the evening Steph and Molly came over. 'Twas good times. 

So, that's my only report this morning, I'm afraid. It's another busy day at the office. I think all of you should go to [hidethecam.com][1] and let me know how it looks and acts on different browsers at different resolutions. Deal? Deal.
