&nbsp;Two days, and two blog posts. Amazing.

With a blog thats updated a little more frequently, it offers the amazing opportunity to ramble on and on about completely unimportant minutia of my day. Right now, my main focus is trying to enjoy coffee. I've always been a little proud of my avoidance of coffee, but at the same time milk a pretty serious addiction to diet soda. With my move into my own personal office space, I get free access to unlimited coffee, which means I've got to try to enjoy it a little more.&nbsp;

Other than trying my damndest to enjoy coffee, I'm working on a few other things. Today I'm working on keeping my nose to the grindstone despite the beautiful day outside and my lack of desire to accomplish anything at all today.&nbsp;
