title: Jason X was so cool.

So, after congratulating myself on a job well done with the PayPal incident as well as a meeting for more work that went surprisingly well, I headed up to DeKalb to visit Jaimee and Wolford and see Jason X.

Jason X was everything I'd hoped it would be. It was so awesome. I can't say that I was too fond of the sci-fi elements they threw in, as well as the similiarity to Aliens, but it was still just a hard core slasher flick at heart, which I love. I doubt many people will share my opinion about the movie, so I guess I'll stop my little review there.

I had to leave early this morning because Jaimee had to work. On my way home, I was on a 2 lane highway, going way too fast. A semi was coming at me in the other lane, and as he passed, he kicked up a pebble into my windshield. I was going about 75, so I assume this pebble was going at least 100 mph. That's pretty fast. It was headed right towards my face, and it scared the living shit out of me. I thought I was going to die. Fortunately, it didn't break my windshield or kill me, although it did make a ridiculously loud "pop" and put a huge crack in my windshield, right in the middle of where I need to look out to drive safely. So, I guess my $200 PayPal victory will be going towards a new windshield for my car. Damn it.
