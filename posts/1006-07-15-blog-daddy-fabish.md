Congratulations to Fabish, who became a daddy last night at 11:03 PM. His wife gave birth to Alise Alexandra (if I heard the voicemail correctly), who weighed in at 7 lbs. and is 19" long. And I'm sure she's adorable. I haven't talked to the parents yet, but hopefully I'll get up to see them tomorrow. 

Other than that, I'm eating at a fancy steak house tonight for the 2nd time in 8 days. I'm eating Taco Bell for lunch as a warm-up.
