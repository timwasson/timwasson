I had a blast all day on Christmas. I'll be honest here for a second, which is a departure for this little blog. I didn't think I'd have a good time running all over the place and seeing everyone under the moon in a day... something I haven't done since I was a kid and didn't really have any desire to do. But I had a good time. I also made quite a haul, getting a bunch of shirts, a new video iPod to replace my ancient 20 gig from last Christmas, a crocheted blanket made by my completely sweet and awesome girlfriend, a bunch of books on wood working and home improvement, some marathon training books and clothes, bowling shoes, a mini-keg of beer, a router, and a ton of stuff I'm sure I'm forgetting. As always, pics are coming soon.
