First up, yesterday and the rain and the thunderstorms were awesome.

Second up, my neighbors were having a moving sale for the entire weekend. I hope that this is really a moving sale and not just a "let's say moving sale instead of garage sale" sale. 

Third and last up, I don't mind getting up in the middle of the night to pee. Sure, I have to walk up and down a bunch of steps to do that, but it's not a hassle. Unless, when I get to the restroom, all I get is a small trickle. Then it's annoying. Then I hate it.

That's all I got for you today.
