Today I'm finishing up the mural for that Swapping Spaces or whatever thing, then going out to my sister's house for my birthday dinner. Not to be picky or anything, but I didn't get to choose the restaurant. Or lack of restaurant. Nor did I choose the meal we're eating. Maybe it's selfish that I expect that on my birthday. Or maybe I'm just bitter because I have a terrible sore throat that I can tell is working itself into a full blown sickness. Either way, I plan to be in bed and asleep by 9:00 tonight, which I haven't done since my 6th birthday, I think. 

24 is old, old, old.
