AKA - There's no place like home.  
AKA - Home is where you hang your hat.  
AKA - Hi Honey, I'm home.

I'm moved in, boys and girls. The rain didn't clear up until around 7:30 or 8, but that didn't slow me down much. I called Robert to give me a hand with the heavy junk, but he was working tons of overtime at his job. He got away for an hour or so to help me with my TV and couches.

My TV was easier to move than I expected, but it still totally messed up my back. See, it's a huge TV (53") and weighs a ton (actually, 215 lbs.). You also can't tip it more than 45 degrees or it gets the guns all out of wack, so I had to stand all best over, holding a huge heavy TV while going backwards up a flight of stairs. It didn't hurt at the time, but it's freaking killing me now. 

I was looking forward to relaxing in a nice hot bath, but there's no hot water.

My rooms aren't set up, and my stuff isn't all unpacked or even completely moved in yet, but I'm proud of the progress so far. 

In other good news: My phone was actually all set up and ready to go. I didn't expect that. Also, when I got my phone hooked up, they offered me an awesome deal on DSL, so I'm making the switch from cable to DSL for way cheaper. Since my first month's rent is free, they're prorating my July rent since they were 5 days late in moving me in. Cheap rent is a good thing. Jaimee is coming to visit me on Sunday. 

All good news. Now I need to see if I can get a satellite hooked up. That would be sweet, baby, sweet.
