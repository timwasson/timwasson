The barbeque at Angie's turned out to be not so horrible, really. That's about all I have to say about that.

Saturday we celebrated Father's Day with the family down in Woodhull. We ate at a buffet. Without sounding like a stuck up snob or anything like that, it's really bizarre what that side of the family considers a nice dinner. They got all dressed up in their best clothes for this restaurant, which was a crappy $8 buffet place. Before we left, my retarded good for nothing uncle was making cracks about my mom's weight. I wanted to just be like "Yeah, well, at least she's accomplished something in her life, fuck stick." I mean, he's an alcoholic, a drug addict, and a huge loser. He mooched off my grandma until the day she died and now he's mooching off my grandpa to support his fat ugly wife and retarded kids. Anyway, I don't have a lot of respect for that little section of the family.

Yesterday I changed my oil in good 'ole Jeepy and finally got around to watching Run Lola Run, which was just awesome. 

It's been a pretty uneventful few days, I guess.
