I love my car. I love her a lot. Her name is Cammy and she's the greatest car the world has ever seen. But, with my new apartment, bad parking, bad gas mileage, high insurance, and other reasons, I am forced to give her up. 

It's a sad day.

She's for sale on Ebay to the highest bidder. Poor Cammy. If you think you can give my girl a loving home, I encourage you to buy her, and let me visit every once in a while.

[Go buy my poor Camaro][1]
