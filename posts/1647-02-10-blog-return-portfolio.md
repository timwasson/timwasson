Many, many years ago I started my first website, Wasson Studios, as little more than a portfolio site with a bunch of my illustrations on it. This was nearly 15 years ago without much competition, so people looking for comic book artists or illustrators online didn't have a whole lot of selection. I was 'discovered' by a small comic book company and paid to draw a couple books for them. They didn't pay well, and I sent them my originals and they never supplied me the final printed book so those drawings are lost forever.

Anyway, back in these days I dreamed of becoming a comic book artist or cartoonist. I eventually gave up on that dream to follow the guaranteed paycheck with website design and development. I do like my job, but I still dream about drawing all day instead of coding, CSS, PHP, and the junk that comes along with freelancing that has nothing to do with creativity at all.

But one of my resolutions this year was to do more creative stuff, specifically get back to my drawing and illustration and hopefully find a way to make a little cash at it. To that end, I've spent the last few days working out a [tool to display some of my art][1]. I also bought myself a Wacom Cintiq, placing it in its permanent home right next to my every day work environment, again, to inspire me to draw more.

I'd blog more, but I'm going to go tinker with my Cintiq now.
