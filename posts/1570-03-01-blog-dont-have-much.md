Don't have much to report. Been working hard trying to find more freelancing gigs, and taking breaks by working on [junkmachine][1]. And still no one from this journal has signed my Pibb petition. For shame.

Fabish cut off all my hair. It's really short now, which is kind of refreshing. It was getting pretty long and pretty annoying. I don't think I'm going to dye it blonde again. Not this time anyway.

I also visited my sister and my little nephew, who is turning into more of a person every day. He's so cool now. I can't wait til he starts moving a lot and talking and smiling and such. He's getting a lot more curious now, always looking around and seeing what's out there. 

Tomorrow night is a party here at the apartment. I'm looking forward to it and dreading it at the same time. Anyone in the Peoria area is welcome to head on over.
