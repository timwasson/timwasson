I'm jumping right into 2003 with the addition of an RSS feed, located here: [RSS Feed][1]. If it works, that's sweet. Reading my blog should be that much easier for ya. I'm still going to do some tweaking and changing, and hopefully adding my moblog stuff to the same feed. But for now, it should be working just fine and dandy. 

Now I just need to finish up the commenting stuff and I get to call this project finished. Finally.
