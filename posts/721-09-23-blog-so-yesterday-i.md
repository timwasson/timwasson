So yesterday I went with Jaimee to her dad's house. One may think that the highlight of the day was winning about 4,500 bags games in a row, but it wasn't. The highlight was trying on a bunch of my "skinny clothes" that I haven't been able to wear in over a year and have about 80% of them fit again. And even though this isn't the weekend anymore, another highlight was getting on the scale this morning and having it stop at a very solid 220. Which means I've lost 30 pounds in the last 4 months. That's almost 4 gallons of milk. 2 heavy bowling balls. 1 bag of manure. I do think I look a bit different, but not 30 pounds different.

Anyway, those were the highlights. The lowlights were very different and I don't think I need to get into them now. I had a really hard time falling asleep last night, but luckily I was able to sleep in until about 10 minutes ago. And now I plan on keep myself really busy all day to avoid thinking about anything of any importance.

In other news, when I was out with Fabish on Friday, he told me about 200 benefits of fasting for 72 hours. So, I've decided to give it a shot. It seems interesting. And even if it doesn't "clean out the toxins" as Fabish promised, it should be a good test of my will power. And it will save me a couple of bucks, too.
