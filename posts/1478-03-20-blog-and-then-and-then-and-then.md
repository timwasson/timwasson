The meeting at Jones Brothers went awesome. I'm doing at least 1 cartoon for them, followed by the possibility of a lot more for the newspaper. We'll see how it goes after they see the finished product. 

So I go home and at around 6 (while I was still supposed to be at the video place) I get a call from a lady I did a portrait for at Christmas. Now she wants a mural for her kid's room done. So, uh, that absolutely kicks ass. 2 random jobs from out of nowhere, both during the time I "should have" been at the video place. A sign? Absolutely. Fuck you, video place! I hate you!
