I've been reading about my name analysis, sign information, and horoscope lately. I don't know why... boredom maybe? I see a lot that applies to me. I don't know if this is because they're true, or because I'm trying very hard to make them applicable to me. I guess it doesn't matter in the long run, eh? Well, here's today's horoscope:

"For October 30: Your ability to communicate  
has never been more important. You're able  
to emotionally connect with others. You  
seduce even diehard nonbelievers and win  
additional support. Superglue yourself to  
people and circumstances that can potentially  
expedite your dreams. Make your most  
eloquent arguments today -- and speak from  
your heart for the greatest impact. Lots of  
discussions, commuting, and schedule  
juggling are likely. FYI: You are deeply in  
touch with your emotions and sensuality this  
evening."

This seems pretty accurate for the goings-on as of late, right? Or am I reading too much into it? I do that a lot.

The schedule juggling is completely wrong, but I can forgive them for that I suppose.
