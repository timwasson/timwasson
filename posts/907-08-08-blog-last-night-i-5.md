Last night I watched Saving Silverman. It was way, way different than I thought it was going to be. I was expecting an intelligent comedy, but this was corn ball and cheesy. It still had it's funny moments though. That Peet girl (Amanda, is it?) sure is hot, even when she's playing a straight up, hardcore bitch. 

I went to bed stupid early last night... like 10 or so. I've been really tired the last few days, but I'm wide awake today. Good thing too, since I have a lot I need to get done on this bloody CD today.
