Okay, so this weekend was pretty great.

Friday was a lazy night, just sitting around watching movies with Jaimee. On Saturday I woke up nice and early to pack and get ready for Fabish's bachelor party. Alan picked me up at about 9:30, and we went to pick up a couple other guys who were heading down with us. We hit up a nice sports bar where we drank huge glasses of beer and ate possibly the best ribs I've ever eaten. Then it was on to the basketball game which I couldn't have cared less about.

Apparently it was a game I should have paid attention to, though. Some guy made a shot as the buzzer went off that just happened to win the game. The refs had a meeting for almost 20 minutes to decide if it should count or not. We left early, so we didn't find any of this out until we got to the next bar.

We spent a few hours bar hopping and trying to convince Fabish that going to a strip club would be a really good idea. He wasn't ever convinced, and no one ended up going to a strip club. Ah well, such is life. 

We didn't get back to the hotel until around 3:30 or so, and I woke up around 8:30 and couldn't get back to sleep. I was really tired yesterday.

Yesterday was also Jack's first birthday party, so Jaimee and I picked out a present for him with my leftover bachelor party fund and partied with my parents and a bunch of people I didn't know. After that, we came home and both fell asleep on my couch right around 8:30.

And now, after 12 hours of sleep, I'm feeling great. Never been better. 

That was my weekend.
