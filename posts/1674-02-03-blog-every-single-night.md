Every single night I work at GP, the fax machine rings. Every single night, it's not a fax, but a lonely voice on the other end. The machine simply beeps, and I hear this voice talking to her son's answering machine. The messages get more desperate and lonely every night. Just now it sounded like she was about to cry. I feel like I should do something, but it's the kind of fax machine without a phone attached and no real way to answer it without unplugging it mid-message. Poor lady.
