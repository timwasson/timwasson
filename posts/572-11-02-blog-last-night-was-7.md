Last night was a lot of fun. I went out with a few of the guys I knew from Iona... Andrew and Shep. We saw Zoolander, which was hilarious, and then went out to eat at Steak 'n Shake. We talked about 3D animation, Flash, and web development. Andrew's freelancing career is taking off much, much faster and better than mine, so I'm happy for him.

After that, I went out to Gorman's with Alan for his 21st birthday. We drank some beers and came back home. Tonight we're going downtown and hitting all the bars, and tomorrow night is the party that I really, really don't want to go to. I'll live, but I won't enjoy it.
