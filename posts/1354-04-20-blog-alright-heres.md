Alright, here's a completely geektastic post. I hope you all enjoy it.

Attention Verizon Wireless subscribers: The big V, otherwise known as the greatest cell phone provider on planet earth, is now offering unlimited pic/text messaging for a measely $5/month! Well, only to other Verizon customers, but it's still a great deal. Especially when you consider that $5 also includes 50 pic/text messages to email addresses or other carriers. Call up and switch or add it... it's a bargain. Plus this promo doesn't expire (meaning once its on your account, it stays there. But soon you won't be able to sign up for it.)

In other geek news, I'm now completely done with the basic functionality stuff on my moblog. I've added the fancy login script and all sorts of commenting madness. Now all I need is people to use it. If you don't mind, could you head over to [my moblog][1] and try commenting and see if you can break the script somehow? Everyone reading this has the awesome opportunity to be my beta tester. How fun for you all! Anyway, I would appreciate it.
