So, for the past few days I've had a pretty nasty pain in my abdomen and left side. I assumed I pulled something while working out a few days ago, but ever since the pain has gotten worse instead of better. I used the internet to self-diagnose, which I know is always a bad idea. Now I'm all paranoid about some obscure disease I probably don't have, but will go ahead and do the treatments recommended by the almighty internet just in case. One of the main things it recommended: Fiber supplements. I'm totally pumped about getting back on my fiber supplement kick, with an actual reason this time. If that doesn't make things better, I'll be forced to make a trip to the doctor's office for the first time in a few years. 

Edit- I called my mom since she's a nurse who knows how to deal with this stuff. She says that it's not only possible, but likely that my "flu" a week or 2 ago as well as the event with me waking up with a poop/puke fit a week earlier may be related to this "infection". She suspects it has to do with my appendix. On her advice, I'm going to the doctor. I hate going to the doctor.

Picture coming a little later, when I'm not at work.
