Tomorrow I have an interview for a job in my field. For fear of jinxing it again, I won't mention the specifics, but I will mention that I'm excited about the prospect of earning good money again, with good benefits and a consistent schedule. And, of course, I'm excited about paying off my credit cards.

Wish me luck. I want out of this crazy cell phone business.
