To celebrate sending in my comic book submission, the hundreds of dollars I've made in the past 2 days, and getting a new job, I went off today to get a new pair of glasses. My old ones were 5 years old and getting yellow and spotty. I didn't even notice until I put on these new ones. Colors are brighter, and no annoying spots anywhere. 

Something weird: My perscription hasn't changed in about 10 years, but today the Doc told me that my astigmatism had actually IMPROVED. He said it's not unheard of, but incredibly uncommon, especially for someone like me who doesn't wear contacts or make any effort to go to the eye doctor or anything. So with these new glasses, my depth perception is completely out of whack. I feel about 10 feet tall when I walk around.
