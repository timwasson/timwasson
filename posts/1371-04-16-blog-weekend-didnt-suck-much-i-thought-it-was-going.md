Yeah, so I already said what I did on Friday.

On Saturday I, as planned, got a haircut (no line, no waiting... amazing), and went back to my parent's to wash and wax my Jeep. It was a beautiful day, so I was driving with the top off and Abby in the back seat, looking like she was having fun. I also bought a new CD player that I installed in record time. That night I was invited to a party, but couldn't go on account of me having to go to church the next day.

I woke up bright and early on Sunday for church with the family, then it was out to my parent's again to eat lunch with my parents, sister, Robert, grandma, grandpa, aunt and uncle, and little cousin. Nothing great happened. It was exactly the same event as we always have together... awkward conversation and long pauses. I just talked to Robert the whole time.

I also bought the New Found Glory CD, which Jaimee did not do justice to in her journal. The CD is great, although I have a question for you LJ punk fans. I have a version of the song 'Hit or Miss' that starts out saying "The mist is what's pretty. All gold and silver. Too bad it can't last", then another guy says "Nothing gold can stay." I hear this is from some compilation punk album with a bunch of different artists. Anyone know what album? I actually prefer that version.

Next weekend it's supposed to be warm but rainy. I want it warm and not rainy.
