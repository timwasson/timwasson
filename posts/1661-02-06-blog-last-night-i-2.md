Last night I was supposed to see "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?", but Angie called me at work and told me she didn't want to go, because she's lame.

So, instead, I was going to go buy a new computer and spend the night setting it up, but for reasons beyond my control, that didn't work either.

Instead I sat at home and didn't do anything. I watched "Silence of the Lambs", which I hadn't seen for about 8 years. That's a good, freaky movie.
