Jesus, I hate today.

I hate customers. Every fucking customer is a god damn idiot, I swear to God. Today a guy asked me how to unlock an AT&T phone to use on T-Mobile. I answered "We're Verizon, so I haven't the foggiest idea." Another asked me how our rates on prepay plans compared to other companies. We're not fucking Progressive. How should I know how much every other prepay provider charges? And besides, prepay customers are fucking useless and I don't want them using my network anyway. And finally, a lady came in asking all the details of TracPhone, yet another wireless provider who isn't Verizon. Why do people assume it's my job to tell them every detail about other carriers? 

I hate customers. I'm also in a piss poor mood today, and nearly screamed at the lady in front of me at the ATM who insisted on letting her kid push the buttons for her, making a 30 second transaction last well over 15 minutes as I stood there with a disgruntled look on my face. Fucking people.

And don't even get me started on how no one knows how to drive. 

I'm glad tomorrow is my day off. This job is driving me fucking crazy and I can't deal with it so many days in a row. Hopefully this job at Illinois Mutual will pay off and I'll make good money without fucking customers.
