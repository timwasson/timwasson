Abby was a much better dog yesterday. I would even go so far as to say she was a good dog. That may be pushing it, but she didn't pee in the house or chew anything up. That's a good thing.

I didn't do anything last night. Mullens and Angie were going bowling in Eureka, but it didn't make any sense to me to drive 45 minutes to go bowling for an hour, then drive 45 minutes back. So, I didn't go. Instead I stayed home, watched TV, fiddled around online a bit, and that was that. 

I've been having weird dreams lately. Usually there's some sort of story that ties the dream together, but not lately. It's just been in a setting with all sorts of weird imagery. The last 3 nights I've had dreams where I was in a huge sky scraper that was really dull looking. I would wander around with people I didn't know, but knew they were my friends. I would look out the windows and see strange things, and every night I've seen huge fires, but they didn't really bother me. Strange.

Tonight is $3/lb. wing night at Garner's. Mullens is all set to watch Boot Camp, so we'll probably do that too. It will be an exciting night.
