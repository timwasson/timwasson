So, moving sucks. I'm still not out of my old apartment, but there's not a lot left to move. Tomorrow I'm cleaning up the joint and callin' it a day. It will be good to finally be out of the joint.

I'm fucking beat down right now. I'm so tired. It's been a long few days, and moving sucks even more when no one is around to help you do it. Even if someone were just hanging around to talk to, it would have made the task more bareable. Fuck moving. Moving blows. I'll be glad once I'm settled into this hizouse and won't move for a couple years. Awesome.
