Well. Here it is. I know everyone was on the edge of their seats, all like "it's a few days past Tim's fifth LJ anniversary without a huge, rambling post about what the year has presented and etc." Well, wait no more, my dear readers.

This year has been a fantastic year. A lot of ups, not a lot of downs. It's all a boy can ask for, really.

About this time last year, I was single and as happy as I've ever been. Alan was preparing to move next door, I was rejoicing in my new found single freedom and the clarity that came with it, spending a lot of time with friends and family.

The year has gotten nothing but better as time has marched on. Angie and I made the leap from "friends" to "more than friends", applying that generic "dating" title that somewhere along the line transformed into "boyfriend/girlfriend". Without getting overly mushy and silly about it, I will say that the transistion is probably one of the best things I've ever done for myself. It's been great, despite our reservations about everything.

And with that, kids, an important announcement. 5 years is plenty long enough to maintain this LJ, and I'll be ceasing and desisting starting immediately after posting this here message. But fear not, dear LJers. My account will stay active so that I can read everyone's entries on my handy friends page, and comment almost as much as I comment now (which is to say, not at all). Also, I'll keep up with my blogging duties through my site, [tim.cx][1]. Why, you ask? Well, I need some motivation to finish projects I start, and this will be my motivation. The PHP/database behind tim.cx was written almost entirely from scratch by yours truly, and I need to complete it. Part of the completion includes an LJ importer, to take all my LJ posts into my own site.

But I'm treading into geekery here, which I feel a bit guilty for in LJ land. In any case, I need to finish tim.cx and release its source code to the world for the world at large to do whatever they choose to do with it. That was always my intention, and I haven't touched the code in months now. 

I'm also going to extend an overly friendly offer to anyone reading this, whether I know you in real life or not. If you'd like to migrate away from LJ and into tim.cx, let me know and I'll hooks you up with the code on my own server as a bit of added motivation/beta testing. You can still post to LJ using the interface I've made, although its not as pretty as LJ's. Anyway, if you're interested, let me know. Hopefully everyone will keep up with my silly stories/geekery/whatever else on tim.cx, but if not, no hard feelings and all that jazz.
