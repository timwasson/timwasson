I just changed my picture.

It's from a video Fabish and I shot the night the crazy old lady went nuts. Windows XP doesn't capture from a Firewire port very easily, kiddies. Just in case you were wondering. I'll have to see if I can get that pesky problem fixed.

My head looks all weird and elongated in the picture. Ah well, it's good enough for now. I'd fix it, but I really just don't care enough.

Maybe I'll fix it anyway, since I'm sitting at home alone on a Friday night at 10:00. May as well be productive, right? Right.
