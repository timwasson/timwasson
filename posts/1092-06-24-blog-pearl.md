At the Pearl Jam concert, Fabish and Amy mentioned that they've been married almost 3 months now. I realized that the wedding was the last time I was clean shaven, and I've had this beard for 3 months now. I like to shake things up with my appearance, so yesterday I shaved the beard. It's a weird feeling being bald in the face. Everything feels weird now. Washing my face, talking, eating, drinking. All different. And maybe not good. The good part is that having a bald face makes my hair look long and huge. It's getting a bit out of control, and it's totally cool. Soon, I'll be too old to look like an asshole all the time, so I have to take advantage of it now.
