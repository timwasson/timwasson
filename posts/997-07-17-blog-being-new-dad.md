So far its been four weeks, and we've managed to keep our baby alive and mostly happy in that time. As new parents I suppose that's about as good as it gets.&nbsp;

Daisy changes and grows every day. Hill and I get so proud when she does new things, even though the new things are pretty insignificant. Finding her fingers to suck on, or raising her head higher than last time, or turning her head towards sounds... they all get us excited and hopeful for the future. I can't wait to see her grow, and crawl, and walk and talk. There's so many milestones to look forward to, and the little bits of progress we see now get me excited for the future.

At the same time, I hate seeing her grow up. Her newborn diapers that were so loose on her when we first brought her home are now close to being a thing of the past. Some of her newborn clothes are getting very tight, and we can probably start the countdown of when she'll be done with those. Its a weird feeling to be so excited to see her get big, but dread it at the same time.&nbsp;

Everyone's advice seems to be to live in the moment and enjoy every day. Even the bad days when she's a little fussier than usual, or awake a little longer at night, you should live in the moment and appreciate the times. They'll be over soon, and you'll miss them. Hill and I both try to follow that advice, and sometimes its harder than usual, but we still mostly succeed I think.
