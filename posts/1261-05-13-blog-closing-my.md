Closing on my house is today.

I just realized that my post yesterday didn't state how I was going to be a national celebrity. That's a shame. I think all my posts should note that at least once or twice.

I saw X2 last night with Robert. I had heard so much about how awesome the fight scene was when Wolverine went apeshit in the mansion that I couldn't help but be a tad disappointed. But damn, Anna Paquin is fine, fine, fine. Even with those wierd teeth.
