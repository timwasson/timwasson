So, I got 2 Nintendos off eBay for $35 in "as is" condition. They were untested, but I figured it was worth the risk. The tested ones were going for $50 and $60 each, even if 1 was broken, it was still a good deal for me. 

Well, I was ecstatic when I popped in Super Mario Brothers and it worked the first time. I also popped in the other game the systems came with... Flying Warriors, which is totally lame. Anyway, it worked without having to play that "blow, then try again" game. 

Today me and Jaimee went looking for more Nintendo games. I bought Paperboy, Friday the 13th, and Nightmare on Elm Street. None worked. We had some success with the blowing trick, although I was getting pissed off at the whole thing. I figured since I had an extra Nintendo, I could take a little risk and see what would happen if I tried to clean it. 20 minutes and a bit of Windex later. I have 1 fully operational Nintendo that doesn't need to be blown on every time you switch games. I plan on giving the other Nintendo the same treatment.

So, why did I buy 2, and what do I plan on doing with the other one? I bought a mini-motherboard which will fit perfectly into the Nintendo, so I plan on converting it into a computer. Should be pretty sweet. 

In other news, Jaimee and I finally got around to watching Amelie. I'll be damned if I can pronounce it, but that is one awesome movie. I've been wanting to see it for some time but have never gotten around to it. Some of the reviews I've read said it was life altering. I wouldn't go that far. But there's definitely a few scenes that will send chills down your spine. 

And that's about it for me. Paperboy isn't nearly as fun as I remembered it to be. Friday the 13th is confusing at first, but a kind of decent game once you catch on. Elm Street is simply terrible. So is Flying Warriors.
