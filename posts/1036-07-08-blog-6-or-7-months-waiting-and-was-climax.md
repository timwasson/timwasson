No pun intended, of course. 

So, the ambiguity of the previous whatever posts is soon to be cleared up. 

As many of you know, Angie and I have had a pretty special bond for many, many years. When Jaimee was packing, during one of our many fights, she referred to my love affair with her. For most of our relationship, I've looked at her as my little sister or just best friend. I was never jealous when she dated someone else, but I did feel some duty to protect her from the bad ones and push her towards the good ones. We've always watched out for each other in a motherly/brotherly way, and with the exception of a year or so when I stopped talking to her for reasons that don't matter now, we've been great friends. 

Well, 7 or 8 months ago, I started getting the impression she wanted more than just the friendship we had. I'd never considered it before. She was always just Angie. I kind of assumed that's all she'd ever be. When I started feeling like a pseudo-boyfriend, I realized relatively quickly that I liked it. It felt right... more right than with anyone else I'd ever been with. It wasn't forced or uncomfortable or awkward. It just worked. 

So a month or 2 later, I decided I wanted the same thing I thought she wanted. But, on the other hand, I was still kinda newly single and still really enjoying the single life. Mix in some insecurities and some "I don't want to ruin a good thing" type feelings, and you had my situation in a nutshell. I did kind of the wrong thing by just sitting on it, doing nothing, for many months in a row. It started dawning on me that if she found someone else, I'd be unhappy with that. And I realized that if I found anyone else, I probably wouldn't like them as much as I like her. 

So 6 or 7 months pass and I make weak-ass passes at her and we kiss when we're drunk. Its fun and all, but I realize it can't last forever. At Mullens' wedding, conversation turned to the big "us", and I found myself at a perfect opportunity to ask her on a real-life date. She graciously accepted without giving me too much of a hard time, and the date was set. 

Anyway, the big date was tonight, and it was fantastic. I'd put some effort and planning into it, to impress her a bit and to prove that I'm taking this seriously, and not just as some "friends with benefits" thing. We went to Alexander's, for a walk along the river, and for a carriage ride downtown. It was a very lovely night. I'm a little embarrassed to admit how nervousI was leading up to it. I mean, it's Angie. I've known her for more than a decade, and we've been really good friends for a big chunk of that. 

On the carriage ride, we had a second "Talk". It was less nerve racking than when I asked her on a date, and it was basically a "so it's been 6 months... where do we go now" talk. The end result is that we're "dating". I'm not 100% sure what this entails, but I don't think I'm allowed to introduce her as my girlfriend just yet. This was mostly my call, as I think it would be way awkward to jump from "friends with an awkward relationship" to "boyfriend/girlfriend" in one fell swoop. We're playing it by ear, going slow, and seeing what happens. 

I'm really happy about the result, really satisfied about the date, and a little weirded out that I'm not single anymore. But weirded out in a good way.
