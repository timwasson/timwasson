I think breathing saw dust and varnish for a couple days made me temporarily crazy in the coconut. Me, my sister, and my mom spent 6 hours in my yard cleaning up crap back there. Then I mowed. I tried to trim, but couldn't start the damn trimmer. Damn trimmer.

Now it's break time. At 5, we're going to visit my grandpa because my aunt is in from Missouri. Then I'm going to come home and put a 2nd coat on those floors. They look even better today than they did yesterday.
