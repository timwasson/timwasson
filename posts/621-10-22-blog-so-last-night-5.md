So last night was fantastic. 

After work I got lost in Bartonville while trying to meet some coworkers, and that was a helluva lot of fun. Then I drove to Pekin and got lost there, which rocked. Eventually I made it to my destination, which was a barbeque with a bunch of people from work. I really like the people I work with, and I love that we never talk about work when we're not at work.

I met Mullens for a couple of beers afterwards at Jimmy's. A few hours after I got there, Alan, Jenny, Emily, Nate, and Angie all came down. It was good to see everyone. I stayed out later than I probably should have, but I had a good time. 

A lot of stuff on the agenda today. People to see, places to go, and yadda yadda.
