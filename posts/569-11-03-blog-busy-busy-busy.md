If you wanna take a look at what's been keepin' be busy in the past few days, there it is. Some stuff doesn't work, but it's getting there.Tell me what you think.

Well, this weekend will be pretty uneventful I imagine. My best friend is in love with this girl who just chose to stay with her boyfriend after stringing him along for a few months. Poor heartbroken boy. I was going to get him drunk this weekend, but he has to study. There's always next weekend I suppose.

My apartment is now painted, which leaves just the shower and carpet left before it's done. Not too shabby... and only about 4 months late. Damn it.

Well, I'm outtie for the day. Peace out, and have a good weekend.
