The house is a-go. The bank has approved our original offer (made in January, believe it or not), and now it's just a matter of when we get the house. We still have a couple of hoops to jump through, but the house is mine, all mine. Yee haw. 

Not much else happening these days. Alan and I went to Hoops and ate pizza for the first time in a very long time, and it was more delicious than I even remembered.
