What a weekend. 

Jaimee and I joined the crew at Donnely's for a few drinks and some hot wings on Friday. Afterwards, she went home to sleep and I went down to see Fabish and Amy at Jimmy's. Good times.

Jaimee left on Saturday morning to go pick up her dog and I had an uneventful day at work. That night I got home and fell asleep on the couch nice and early. I woke up in time for Wild Things 2, which I didn't even know existed, then fell back asleep for a good long time after that. 

Sunday was a big day. Jaimee brought her dog back, but her and Winnie haven't exactly been getting along as well as planned. While breaking up a fight, Winnie managed to tear a huge chunk of skin out of my arm, exposing the bone beneath. Well, not really, but she bit pretty hard and definitely punctured the skin pretty good in one area, and left toothmarks on the other side of my arm. Bailey caused damage to my hand on the same arm. It hurts pretty much all the time, whenever I move any part of my arm. 

Now I'm back at work. I don't like it here.
