With my new phone I can get on AIM. I tried using the same screen name I've had since forever, but with all the fanboy chat I get, I realized that was a horrible idea. Instead, I've adopted a new screen name for the task.

If you want to send me instant messages directly to my phone via AIM, then add the buddy "wassonphone". It should always be signed on and it will cause me less trouble than using my old screen name.
