A few more noteworthy events of this weekend.

Our hot water heater exploded. I don't know why or how, but Jaimee and I had to carry buckets of steaming hot water from one room to another, making many trips before it had emptied enough to not shoot out like mad anymore. It was an exciting adventure, but it worries me that it may happen again. We'll see. Hopefully not.

Optimus' head is coming along swimmingly, if I do say so myself. At this point, all I have to do is not get bored with it and I'll finish it within a month, I reckon.

I've started taking vitamins.

I ran 2 miles last night and 1 mile this morning. I'm going to try and keep that pace for the rest of the week and see how I feel, but right now my legs are kilin' me.
