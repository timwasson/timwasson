With my new diet, I've had to give up a lot of food I love. I thought the cravings would go away, but alas, they have not. So, the list:

Cheese fries, double quarter pounder from McDonald's, Hamburger Helper, anything from Long John Silvers, brownies, Mr. Pibb, cheese sticks, cheese balls, Meat Lover's from Pizza Hut, baby back ribs, nachos, cinnamon bread, Avanti's gondola, fried mushrooms, a triple steakburger with cheese and bacon from Steak 'n Shake with a cookies and cream shake, shrimp, garlic bread with mozzarella, Sun Chips, Corn Nuts, anything with lots of cheese, anything fried, anything meat.

So, there it is. But, on the other hand, I'm lighter and smaller than I was a month ago, which is good. 3 out of 4 of my fat pants can go on and off without unbuttoning them. I fit into a pair of 36 shorts. All good things, but I want my food back.
