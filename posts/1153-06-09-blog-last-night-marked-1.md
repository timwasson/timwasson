Last night marked my last Building Steam class. It was a sad and happy event at the same time. I've really enjoyed the class and will definitely miss it. The good news is that there's talk of continuing the classes into the summer. And the other good news (if you can call it that) is that I think I've decided that I'm enjoying this running nonsense enough that I'm going to join the Illinois Valley Striders and participate in more races. And while I'm at it, I think I'm also going to join the River Plex and try more classes, like spinning or body pump or things like that. I'm really digging the classes and meeting new people and the whole competitive aspect of it. Plus my company gets a fat discount from River Plex, so that's a bonus. 

Anyway, so after the class we went to Old Chicago to celebrate our little victories. The race is Saturday, and I'm a little too excited. I think it's unnatural how pumped I am about this silly race, but I'm really looking forward to it. 

Not much else to report lately. Just doing a lot of sitting around when I'm not sleeping or doing laundry. Oh, and I'm trying not to sweat my ass off while just sitting in my house, but that's hard to do when I refuse to turn on my air conditioning and its 95 degrees in my house. Such is life.
