Last night I got Steph really pissed off at me, because I called her and her boyfriend hypocrites. Apparently that's not a friendly thing to do, but I'm pretty passionate about that sort of thing.

But, the rest of the night was good. Molly and Steph came over and we just sort of hung out and did nothing in particular. Good, lazy times. That's what summers are for, if you ask me. Which you didn't.

So, I put some statistics links on my page a few nights ago and was monitoring how it was doing through the day. I got almost 200 hits, which is pretty good. Most were from WebTV though, which is a bit strange. I didn't know it was so popular. I wish I didn't have so much to do at work today... I'd love to work on it.
