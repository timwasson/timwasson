Hi, I'm Tim. I don't know why you're here, but its probably because you know me from real iife somehow. If you do know me in real life, you can feel free to skip this boring and egotistical about page. If you don't know me, you can feel free to read on although I'm not sure why you'd want to.

I'm a self-employed website designer and developer, but I dream of turning my web development business into an illustration business. My ultimate goal is to draw monsters and robots all day, every day. However, I've been checking the classifieds for the past 15 years or so and have yet to come across any jobs that fit my criteria. Until I get lucky enough to live that dream, I am pounding away at website development.

But please don't think I'm only into stuff like the internet and design. I'm also into equally nerdy but less computer-y things, like horror films and building stuff out of wood. I'm probably involved in too many projects, and I constantly have ideas for "the next big thing", which never really turn out to be a big thing at all.

I live in Peoria, Illinois with my wonderful wifey and our 2 wonderful dogs. And life is good.
