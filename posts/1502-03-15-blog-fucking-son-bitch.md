I called our family lawyer today to see what I can do about this guy wasting a week of time in which I could have been making money. Unfortunately his advice was to forget it. It would take $300 to get the case into small claims court with no guarantee that it would ever be heard, much less won. I would probably end up spending $800 to win a $1000 case. Plus even more wasted time. So I've filed a complaint to the Better Business Bureau, to PayPal, and to his web server. If I can't get my money I'm going to waste his time and give him a bad reputation.

This couldn't have come at a worse possible time. I'm so broke, with bills due. This money was going to get my head above water for the first time in months. God, this fucking sucks. I guess it doesn't pay to be a nice guy in business. I was more than reasonable and compromised more than I should have, and I still get screwed up the ass. It's days like this I wish I had never quit Iona.

The last few months have been disappointment after disappointment, and there is no end in sight. I wish I was smart enough to think of a quick money making scheme, but I'm really not. Well, I suppose I could make some quick cash with a porn site or something similar, but I'd rather not sell my soul to the devil for money.
