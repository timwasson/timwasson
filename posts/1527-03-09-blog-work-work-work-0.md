A busy day at work. I had a lot to get done on this other project, when sometime near 11 they told me about a new project they needed done by 4. I didn't think there was any way to do it, but we got it done, with minor interruptions asking me for job quotes for other clients, and fixing my computer's network connection. But everything worked out great and today flew by, and I just remembered that Abby may be waiting for me when I get home. This will be a good day after all. I like good days.

Everyone keeps coming to my cube thanking me for all the work I did on that craptastic project. That's a good feeling.
