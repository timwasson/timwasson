For those interested (and I count 0 of you), this is the difference 30 pounds makes on my 6'2" frame. These are the offical before and after shots from the biggest loser competition at work, where my team placed 2nd and I won a cup for my troubles. Not quite as good as the $150 grand prize, but I'll take it.
