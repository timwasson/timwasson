I am really tired right now. Not only did I wake up at about 6:30 this morning, but I also woek up at 6:30 with about 3 hours of sleep under my belt.

Dinner with Barb wasn't terrible, although it wasn't great either. I've been avoiding her purposely for a few months... dodging her phone calls and making excuses as to why I can't hang out with her. Well, tonight she told me about how depressed and, for lack of a better word, messed up she's been since her dad died. I felt so bad for deserting and ignoring her. We'll never be the best of friends, but I could have been more understanding towards her situation than I have been. 

Right after I got home from dinner with Barb, Molly called me and came over to hang out for a bit. We went to Perkins, but called it a night early since we were both a bit sleep deprived and very tired.

So, you say, it's about 1:30 now, why aren't you in bed? Well, the apartment above mine is having a party with horrible, thumpy music. This is the first one of these awful parties that they've thrown, and they threw it on the one night I really wanted some sleep. Strange how that works sometimes. I guess I'll just have to sleep in until 1 or 2 tomorrow afternoon to make up the difference.

In an unrelated note, Steph gets home from Colorado for good on Sunday night. Yee haw.
