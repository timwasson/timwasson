A big thank you and word up goes out to one of my favorite websites, [The Unofficial Apple Weblog][1] who posted a link to my review and unpacking photos, which really ramped up my traffic for the month to about 6 times the visitors this humble site is used to. It was much appreciated. 

Ah, life barrels on. I've spent my time doing really fascinating stuff lately, including cleaning out my garage, my basement, posting stuff on eBay, working on websites, and playing with my new Mac mini. It's quite the life I lead. Mostly I'm just looking forward to St. Patrick's Day. What's everyone's plans for the big day (I ask like I'm expecting responses or something)?
