Well, after a long, hard, and extremely frustrating day at work, I went home in the hopes of doing absolutely nothing for the remainder of the day. I had to unwind and get prepared for today, which will undoubtedly be just as frustrating as yesterday. It already is as frustrating, actually. 18 minutes into it, 8 hours, 42 minutes to go.

So, after getting home last night I talked to Fabish for a while, then his sister and KJ came over, but they left for a baseball game, so I watched Dogma with the commentary on. Good stuff. It was exactly what I needed and wanted to do last night. 

My parents stopped by, and I vented to them about how much my job sucked. I told them how incredibly close I was to just up and quitting yesterday, and while they weren't pleased, they seemed to understand my situation. I don't think they would blame me one bit if I got pissed, quit, and was out of a job for a few weeks. They'd support me, I bet. At 21, I don't think I would feel bad mooching off my parents. I'm still young. I can do that.

Why is it so cool in July in Illinois? Weird.
