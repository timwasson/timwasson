Man oh man.

So, it started yesterday when I was all geared up for a long day of working to finish up this stupid project that I'm already sick of doing. I got up around 10:30, showered, the whole routine, then sat down and worked for a good 10 minutes. Then Fabish called me to the living room for an episode of Junkyard Wars, which is absolutely the coolest show in the world. The teams are put in a junkyard and assigned a task, like building a car or a boat or a hovecraft or something. Anyway, it turned out to be a Junkyard Wars marathon, so I pretty much didn't move from the couch all day, and instead I watched 13 hours straight of Junkyard Wars. It was a stupid things to do, but you gotta be stupid every once in a while.

Mullens stopped by and we drank a few beers, and he was all upset about his troubles in paradise. At around 12, we decided to hit some trashy bars outside of Peoria that we had never been to, so after picking Angie up at Becky's and dropping her off at her place, we headed out on the town.

It's kind of fun hitting those types of bars. Everyone was trashed out of their mind and acting retarded. It's not the kind of scene I'd like to hit every night, but once in a while, it's a lot of fun.

Mullens and I had some sort of deep conversations about how it takes me a long time to forgive and forget because I analyze things too much. A lot of people in this world think my analytical side is a negative... I disagree completely. I think it's one of my better traits.

So, I didn't get in last night until around 6 am, which I haven't done in a long, long time. I woke up to a ringing phone today at noon... it was my dad, reminding me of the Thanksgiving lunch at my parent's house that I was missing as we spoke. I got there as soon as I could, but I had already missed the lunch. Ann and Harry were there... I have no idea how I'm related to them. My neighbor, Emma Byers was there, Sarah, Robert, Grandpa, Cathy, and Dave. Sarah is looking very, very pregnant. With just 2 weeks until her due date, I suppose that should be expected.

so, I got home from that at around 6:30, and planned on working on this project again. But I'm just too damn tired. Alan is having some of his loser friends over tonight, so I may just drink a couple beers and be asleep in bed by 11. That sounds good.
