Last night marked the 3rd time in a row I played designated driver to a group of drunk asses. It was this kid's 21st birthday, PK, who I don't really know, but Alan and Jenny did. So we took him out to get shit faced drunk, which turned out to be a not-so hot idea. 

We started as a big group at Jimmy's, a slightly smaller one at Kelleher's, smaller still at Roxy's, and very small by the end of the night. At around 3, PK was stumbling into Big Al's with me right behind him. He mentioned vomitting, so I quickly turned him around and took him to the alley close by to take care of the whole puking thing where it would be less embarassing. And it was disgusting.

By the time we got to Richard's, he was pissed off at the world and making everyone else pissed off, too. As the sober guy in the bunch, it was sort of my responsibility to keep my eye on him and make sure he didn't do anything too retarded. I didn't do a very good job. He started yelling about wanting to go home and he stormed off, in the completely wrong direction.

Anyway, long story short, he somehow got away and, we think, walked home. If he didn't walk home, then he completely disappeared. And we all vowed to never drink with this guy again. I wasn't a fan of him. Not at all.

But overall, this driver thing is A-OK with me. I get to save some dough and still go out, and I remember everything and in the right order. Who needs drunkeness?
