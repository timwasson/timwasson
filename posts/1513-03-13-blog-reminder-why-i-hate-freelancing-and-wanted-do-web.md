title: a reminder on why I hate freelancing and wanted to do the web thing.

Anyhoo, I've bene hard at work for far too long on this web page I'm doing for one of my clients. He's from Singapore, and his English is not the best I've ever heard (or read, as the case may be) so getting the project done has been pretty trying.

And not only that, but he's one of those clients who keeps wanting more and more and more without expecting to pay for it. It's really pissing me off. I'm kind of over a barrel though, since I've only gotten a $200 down payment and have done $1000 worth of work. I may end up just swallowing my pride, doing it for free, and sending him a nasty email once I'm paid. That will work nicely.

I've had experiences in freelancing like this before, which is a rude reminder of why I wanted that web page to start making money and I wouldn't have to deal with it anymore. 

And speaking of that webpage, it's been up for about 3 weeks now and I finally made my first sale. Followed closely by my second sale. That's $17 the page has made me. $3,983 to go and it will have broken even. In the meantime, $17 will buy me a nice ass dinner. Or it will buy Jaimee a birthday present. It'll probably go towards #2.
