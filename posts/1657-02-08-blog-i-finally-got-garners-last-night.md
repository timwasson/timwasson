title: I finally got Garner's last night.

It had been a few weeks since we last ate at Garner's on a Wednesday night. 

I picked Fabish up and we met Mullens and Brice at Garner's. We walked in and saw all the employees wearing matching shirts with Garner's logos on them. What's up with that?

Now, Garners used to be such a dive. The floors and tables were always dirty, there was buffalo wing smoke in the air, the people who worked there were never clean, and the wall's paint was flaking off and dirty. But, they had awesome hot wings and that was that. When we used to make trips, we were the only ones in the place. We'd have full access to their big screen TV, and the waitresses would come out and sit with us. Good times, good times.

But, Garner's was just bought by some franchise. They still have great wings, but now the walls are painted with flowers, the carpeting is new, the employees bathe, and the tables are wiped clean. Now, you may think of all these as good changes, but not us old school Garner's people.

There's always a lot of people in there now too, so we have to watch our language and not get too loud. It sucks. What's the point now that it's just a normal restaurant? Ah, but I digress. 

So, it was a good dinner, and after words we went our separate ways. Fabish went with me to Office Depot to pick up a wireless keyboard that it turns out they were sold out of. Then we went to Best Buy to pick up a sound card and a new phone for yours truly. 

I spent the rest of the evening being a huge dork and installing more computer stuff and configuring my computer. It was a blast. 

Tonight I get to draw naked people.
