For those who don't know, one of the fringe benefits of my job is that I get an hour per week to work out on company time. So, twice a week I combine my half-hour lunch with a half-hour work out in the middle of the day. This is important and interesting for several reasons.

1. I usually jog 2.5 miles and spend 10 minutes or so "cooling down" on the stationary bike. With everyone making their New Year's resolutions, the company gym is overrun with people there who are either lazy or just doing it to get out of an hour of work. Today I was jogging at 5.5 miles per hour next to a lady who was doing 2.7 miles per hour. She started after I did and stopped before I did, then took some time to lean against the wall, "stretch" and drink water. Does she really think she's doing anything for her health?

2. As I get in better shape, I sweat more. I've now started sweating from the backs of my arms. I don't sweat from my chest, which is a shame.

3. I shower after my work out. It still weirds me out showering at work.

4. Today I forgot an extra pair of undies, so I'm going commando. My only other commando experience is with jeans, which I found incredibly uncomfortable and even a little scary with the zipper and all. With my khaki's, its a different and wonderful experience.

Oh yeah, and Happy Birthday Blandon.
