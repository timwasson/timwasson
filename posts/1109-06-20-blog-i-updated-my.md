I updated my default picture with a really bad picture I took last night in a dark room with a crappy web cam. To see the picture (and my new weird hair) in all it's glory, click [here][1]. 

So, last night Missy called. We went to dinner, then watched the Real World Reunion, then she went home. I played with the dog for a little while, dicked around online, and went to bed. Exciting stuff, I tell you. 

Tonight I will do a lot of work to [hidethecam][2]. I know, I've been slacking lately... but actually have been doing a little work on it every night, just not uploading anything because it's not complete yet. Soon, though.... soon.
