It's fate, baby, fate.

Terrible day today. Terrible, frustrating, awful fucking day. I won't bore you with the details, but I will say that it has to do with financing for my house and my lack of tax knowledge.

The good part of today... I was working at the gallery and my dad stopped in. I assumed it was about the house and the paperwork and the nonsense. Nope. He was just at a baby store getting something for Jack and the lady in front of him in line asked about someone to paint murals. The lady working handed her a book saying an artist had dropped it off. They had nothing to do with the artist except they referred people to him. My dad waited for this lady to leave, then asked what it took to be an artist that they would push. Apparently, all I have to do is drop something off. People haven't been happy with the quality of that painter anyway, and they were looking for a new one to push. And, they're also looking for an artist to do sketches of some type. I need to stop in and get the details. I'm so glad this is working now. This fits. This feels right. This feels like what I'm supposed to be doing, and I think everything is finally falling into place.
