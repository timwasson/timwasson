I'm looking for a song. It's a good song, but I don't remember the lyrics. I think it's by someone named Livehouse or something similar. It's a slowish song and the singer sounds familiar, but I can't place where's I've heard him. Livehouse gets me now results on Napster, but I really want this song. Anyone who can turn my vague information into a song will get my eternal gratitude. Or at least temporary gratitude.
