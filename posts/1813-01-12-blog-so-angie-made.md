So Angie made potato soup and invited me over for a bowl. When I got there, her dog was in trouble for chewing up the rug. This may seem like an unimportant detail, but trust me, it's not.

We ate potato soup and watched the grand finale of The Biggest Loser, which sure is a fantastic show. Gary's transformation was incredible. 

So at one point we let the dogs out to do their business. Winnie went in and out quickly, taking care of business then coming right back. Izzy stayed out there for a long time and refused to come to the door when called. About 10 minutes later she finally came back in, with huge foot long carpet strings mixed with shit still stuck in her butt. It was pretty much the most hilarious thing I've ever seen. Izzy looked so embarassed.

After that I hung out with Alan and Emily for a while. I'm really going to like living next to him, I reckon.

How 'bout this new Mac Mini, eh? Pretty nice. And the iPod Shuffle? Now no one has an excuse to not get Appled out. 

I've always been considered an asshole for about as long as I can remember. That's just my style. -- Royal Tenenbaum
