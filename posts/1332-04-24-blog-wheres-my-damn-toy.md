I want my toy, but he hasn't shipped it yet. I want it now.

I bought Behind Enemy Lines and The Man Who Wasn't There last night, because I'm lame and can't help myself from buying toys and worthless stuff. I've resisted for so long, but I'm not giving in. 

Behind Enemy Lines has the sweetest chase scene in the world with the fighter plane and the missiles chasing it. The Man Who Wasn't There is just freaking amazing in every sense of the word. Of course, it's a Coen Brothers movie, so its to be expected.

My parents are coming to take me to dinner soon. I'm hungry. So far today I've eaten a banana and a fish stick.

This has been a lame entry.
