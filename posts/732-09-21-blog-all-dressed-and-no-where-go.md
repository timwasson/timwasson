I was all excited to go to Oktoberfest last night, but alas, couldn't get a hold of MrJim on his cell phone. Angie and I had made back up plans because her date wasn't calling and I couldn't get a hold of the group I needed to get a hold of, but those fell through once her date actually did call. Then I fell asleep on the couch watching Interview with the Vampire, missing a phone call from Fabish inviting me to Jimmy's. But, at that point, I figured I was too tired to go anywhere or do anything.

Ah, it was for the best, I imagine. I shouldn't be spending any money. After all, I'm unemployed.
