It's been an uneventful few days. Ah well, such is life, sometimes. 

Things are going well for me, though. This freelancing thing is great, and I am making some fat cash. 

My one big client is a guy named Dave. I'm working on the graphics for a site called funnyprizes.com for him, in which you submit your email and the email of 5 of your friends, and you get a free prize. He runs a newsletter that is sent out to 2 million people per week, and they will be endorsing funnyprizes.com in this newsletter. He expects 1 million people to visit funnyprizes.com within the first month.

One million. One friggin' million visitors. 1 million people. 1 million people are going to see my drawings. A MILLION PEOPLE WILL SEE MY DRAWINGS. In case you don't understand, let me explain it a little more. 1 million people are going to see my illustrations.

Granted, they're not the best drawings in the world. They're drawings I would have done at like 10 or 12 years old, but that's not the point. The point is that I have never done anything that people would have seen on such a wide scale. I mean, 1 million is huge. I can't even grasp how many people 1 million people is, and they're going to be seeing something I had a hand in creating. That alone is worth more money than Iona ever could have given me. 1 million.

So I was talking to Dave tonight, and he wants to send me a semi-consistent income. Marvelous! He alone is going to be paying me almost as much as I made at Iona (after taxes, so I still need to make some money from other clients), which will be nice... I'll have some reliable income.

AND, as if that wasn't enough, once I get junkmachine up and running, he's going to advertise it for me via his newsletter. I plan on junkmachine.com being just like an entertainment site with games and movies and music and such, by me and other people. Hopefully I can rig something up so people can submit their own games and movies. It should be good. Good 'ole junkmachine.

It will be a lot of work and many months in the making, but hopefully I can make something good out of a crappy domain like junkmachine.com. 

So, that's all the news in my life right now. I'm so glad I quit Iona. And to think, a little more than a month ago I was all frustrated and pissed off that I wasn't getting any jobs. Who would have thought I'd be here this early in the game? Meeting Dave was a lucky break.

I've got a meeting at Iona tomorrow for an upcoming project. I'm also going to Best Buy to buy a copy of Windows XP... it's $99 for the upgrade, but with the upgrade I'll get 256 megs of RAM free, a free MP3 player, a free music CD, and a free cable/DSL router. Granted, I don't \*need\* any of those things, but they couldn't hurt, right? Right.
