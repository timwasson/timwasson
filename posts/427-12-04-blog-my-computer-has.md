My computer has been cleaned and is running cooler, crashing less, and probably won't need replacing. But it's still really loud. Such is life.

A bunch of people I either don't know or don't like are at my house right now. I hate it. 

I got a new phone for Jaimee today. I'm jealous of it and want to steal it, but I'm holding off for my Samsung 670, with a camera, flash, and photo caller ID on the outside. I do so love my gadgets.
