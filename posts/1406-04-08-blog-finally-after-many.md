Finally, after many long days, the [timwasson.com][1] renovation is finished. And, if I do say so myself, it's the best webpage in the whole entire world. I mean that seriously.

Next up: A couple modifications to [junkmachine.com][2]. I'm debating as to whether to go ahead and keep working and finish it up tonight or do it tomorrow. On one hand, I've been ultra productive lately and don't want to ruing my streak. On the other hand, I'm bored sitting at my computer and want to watch TV or something now.
