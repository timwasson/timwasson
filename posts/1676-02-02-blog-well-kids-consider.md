Well kids, consider another theme cancelled. My company announced yesterday their own version of "The Biggest Loser", which means cash prizes for losing weight. Which means I need to be at my heaviest for the first weigh-in on the 15th. No eating right or exercising for this kid... money is on the line.

To celebrate, Mullens, Anna, and I went to Hooters last night. Tonight is maybe, hopefully, Hoops with Polk. Sweet.
