Hey, Wolfie and I (with some help from Dave and Randy) shot our first actual scripted piece for Horror Junk, and I'm proud enough of it to put it here. We shot it for something else, but it found it's way to our show and for inclusion on this DVD we'll be handing out this weekend. 

Anyway, it's really not bad for the amount of time we spent on it, but if I had it to do over I'd have changed just a little bit. But I still think it turned out totally rad for a first attempt at something scripted and planned for a first time in a long time.
