I was just out jogging. I was nearing the end of my 2 miles and getting a bit tired. I guess I dragged my feet a little too much and totally wiped out right on the sidewalk. I feel totally cool right now, especially with a bloody knee that hurts like a motherfucker and 2 scraped up palms. Screw you, jogging! Screw you, getting in shape!

Reasons to go jogging at night rather than in the daylight:  
1. You won't get sunburned.  
2. You won't get horribly sweaty.  
3. Less people around to see you fall and humiliate yourself.
