So far, Wendy has called about 6 times today about the status of her packing and arranging. Every time, she offers me more free furniture. Every time, I say "yeah, sure. Whatever you don't want, just leave it and I'll take care of it." She keeps going down a list of free furniture, and I keep giving her the same response. I'm not going to answer the phone anymore when she calls. 

We already got a good deal on the house. She's already given me all her lawn care equipment and grill and lawn furniture and many other things. It's getting to be a better and better deal, but it doesn't make it any less annoying.
