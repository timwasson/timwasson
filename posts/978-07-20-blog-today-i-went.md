Today I went out to Mullens' house to play on his motorcycle. I tried driving it one other time in high school, but I sucked at it. This time I rocked it out hardcore and convinced myself that I absolutely need one. Motorcycles are totally sweet. 

In other news, I fucking hate Alan's retarded dog. And I hate that I have to take care of it while Alan boozes.
