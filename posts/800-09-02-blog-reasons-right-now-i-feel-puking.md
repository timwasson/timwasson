I just wrong a long as post but have now deleted it. Let me sum it all up in just a few sentences:

Right now, I'm every single bad emotion that anyone could ever feel. I hope you all die in a horrible car accident or something more painful. I've decided to go this alone. No more depending on people, trusting people, believing people. From now on, everyone I know is a filthy fucking liar who doesn't deserve my time. I hate you all. Go to hell.  
Fuck this noise. I'm going home.
