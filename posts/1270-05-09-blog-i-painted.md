I painted a food cart for Sully's. It sucked ass. It's one of those food carts that sits downtown in the courthouse. They had locked up the cart in a dark alley, where I did my painting. It was stainless steel, and despite purchasing all new paints, nothing would stick worth a damn. The alley smelled like urine. I was afraid to sit on the ground because of the aforementioned urine smell. So I squatted the entire time, really hurting my legs. The final product turned out pretty mediocre because of the paint issues and the uncomfortability issues. But such is life, right? 

Tonight is dinner at Kouri's with Bryan J. Polk himself. The rest of the weekend will be spent bored, by myself, dreaming of my live national television appearance. Fame and fortune, here I come.
