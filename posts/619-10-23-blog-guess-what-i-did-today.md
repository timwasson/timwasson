... nothing. Nothing at all. An exaggeration? I wish. No, I didn't do anything, and it sucked. I'm leaving early again, just as I do everyday. But, I felt like I should stay here a little longer than usual, and needed a way to waste time until then. I decided to type in this thing. So far I've wasted 34 seconds.

That's long enough. I'm outtie.
