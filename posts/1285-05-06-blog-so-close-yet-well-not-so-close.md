My goal was to lose 30 pounds during this 3 month competition at work (and my other goal was to not talk about weight loss stuff very often. Mission failed), and I'm sitting at 27 pounds down (although 33 pounds down if you count from the offical start of the diet), with 6 days left to the end. 3 pounds. 6 days. Very little food. Very much exercise. I'll probably do it, but it'll be a miserable 6 days. 

I still haven't posted the pictures from dress up night because I'm lazy and have been dealing with other web page issues at the moment. I'll probably do it tonight on account of my diet preventing me from doing anything fun.
