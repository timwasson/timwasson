As if you couldn't have guessed, I went ahead and went to Jimmy's last night. I showed up late and most of the people I was meeting were already half-cocked. I planned on staying for a beer then heading home, but after the talk of going downtown and cabs, I volunteered to stay until Jimmy's closed, then drive them downtown and let them take a cab home. It was a fine plan until they chose to go to The Lucky Lady and somehow convinced me to tag along. 

It ended up being not as bad as I expected. It wasn't so busy, and I wasn't the oldest there. I wasn't really tired and wasn't really drinking, so I figured I could stick it out and give them a ride home. It was a fun night all around. Marie and I have known each other for years, but finally bonded after she kept telling me I was her favorite person and how she "hearted me". Her husband Dain, his friend Darren, and Angie were also there. 

Today I did some laundry and headed out to my parents' house to help with their computer. Angie and I went to Chili's and to see Meet the Fockers, which was funny but not as funny as the first one. And now I'm home, wishing I was more tired so I could get a ton of sleep as I like to do before my Monday.

Liz: It's just that with Ed here, it's no wonder I always bring my flatmates out, and then that only exacerbates things.  
Shaun: What you mean?  
Liz: Well, you guys hardly get on, do you?  
Shaun: No, I mean, what does "exacerbates" mean?
