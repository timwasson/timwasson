I keep thinking to myself I need to upload more stuff to YouTube. I don't know why. Just a weird motivation to put my stuff out there to the world, but it was always a hassle. Record something with a camera/camcorder, import it to the computer, edit it slightly, log into YouTube, describe and upload. Thankfully my fancy new iPhone 3GS skips all that, and includes a video camera that uploads directly to YouTube without any of the other crappy steps. As a result, you get videos like this.
