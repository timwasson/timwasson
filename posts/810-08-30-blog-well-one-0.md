Well, one of my auctions finished for $200, which I was pretty excited about. Unfortunately, the winner turned out to be a deadbeat. So, I'm going to have to relist. And that sucks. But such is life.

I've been really, really busy lately. Hopefully that will end tonight. I feel lame, though. It's been so long since I've actually been making my own money and doing well at it that it's a welcome change, and I feel bad when I'm not working. I've had a really good couple of weeks, financially speaking, and I want to keep it up.

I've still only gotten 2 orders from custom-art.com, but it's still adding to the site to hopefully make it profitable, even if it takes years. I'm not sure what else I'll try after this, but certainly something.
