On the agenda today: do my taxes. Do a portrait. Make a few phone calls. Watch Battle of the Sexes. 

I just bought TurboTax, but man, do I ever hate doing my taxes. I'll put it off as long as I can.

Since getting the email and phone call about The Screen Savers, it's really hard for me to think about anything other than my live, national television appearance.
