I know, I've been slacking on my blogging duties in a big way. That doesn't mean that things aren't happening, it just means it's been hard to find the time to type about life when I've been too busy living it.

My good buddy Rad Jose made a temporary return to good 'ole Central Illinois, so I was at his beck and call for his trip, hanging out whenever possible and trying to squeeze in some real work.

Hill's birthday was yesterday, which she shared with Mother's Day. It was sort of a triple-celebration day between visiting her family in Pontiac, mine in Brimfield, and when that was all done we celebrated her birthday in the trashiest way we could think of... in a bowling alley bar playing pool and those photo-hunt games. We are a classy couple for sure.

Other than that, life is rolling on and I'm remaining tight-lipped about various things I'm doing, but details are coming as things get finalized.
