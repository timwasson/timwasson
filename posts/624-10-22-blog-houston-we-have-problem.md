title: Houston, we have a problem.

So I spent the weekend in Houston. It was a short visit, and filled with a lot of "wedding" related stuff. It was my first visit to Texas, and unfortunately I didn't get to see the sights or "real" Texas. We were smack-dab in the heart of yuppie-ville, so most of the stuff there I can see in yuppie-ville Peoria. I was anxious to see the guys in huge hats, snake-skin boots, carrying rifles and chewing tobacco everywhere they go. What I got was people driving their Benzes and Lexuses and wearing suits or Polo shirts. Every once in a while I'd hear a hint of the Southern accent, but even those moments were few and far between.

Still, it was a fun weekend, and I continued my streak of never, ever, ever being delayed or late during flights. Okay, well, I got into Peoria about 8 minutes later than expected but that's pretty minor compared to some people's complaints.

Now that vacation is out of the way, and I'm going to buy a big, flat-screen TV. Yes, between the house deal, selling the Jeep, my old fridge, and rebate coming to me from the escrow on my old house, I'm doing extremely well financially speaking. I've been using my current TV for 5 years now, and for a tech-geek like myself that just won't do. Besides, my current TV was free because I sold enough cell phones to earn one... this will be a good one. I'm excited.
