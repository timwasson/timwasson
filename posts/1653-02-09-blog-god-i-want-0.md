God, I want a new job. Any new job.

My second nephew is due any day now, and I can't wait. Tomorrow I'm painting a mural in his new room. Tonight I'm working out. For at least a half hour. 

I haven't had a customer walk into the store in 6 hours.

I'm running out of things to do.

I need junkmachine.com to be back up and running soon. 

I need a better paying job.

But for the most part, my life is good. I can't complain about much. I'm getting that itch again. Anyone who has ever felt it knows what I mean. The itch to do something productive, creative, and maybe even a bit profitable. Another comic, now that I'm financially able to take it beyond the approval stage? Finish Optimus and get back on TV? I'd love to sculpt something. I'm really in the mood to sculpt.
