I just got a call from Illinois Mutual about my new position. They're setting up both a PC and a Mac for me to use and needed a list of software I'll need for each. This is so weird to be getting back into my field and putting in requests for thousands of dollars of software, knowing I'll actually get it. Unlike Iona who encouraged me to find free trials of anything I knew I'd need past the 30 days. 

Still, I'm really happy about getting back into my field. And having an "office" which is really more of a cube but doesn't matter. Vindication at last!
