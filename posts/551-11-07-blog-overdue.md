Those who know me best know I get sick about once every other year, and this is my year. Sometime this winter, I'll start puking my guts out and I won't stop puking for 3 days or so. Okay, that's not exactly true... I'll spend about half a day puking and the rest of the time complaining about it, moping, and watching TV.

Anyhoo, Wolford and my little side project is going better than any of our other side projects I can remember off the top of my head. About another 20 minutes worth of editing, and the first video podcast will be finished. Phew. The first one will probably be the most difficult, and we'll soon learn how to talk less and edit faster. Man, I had no idea how much I could talk if you just turn a camera on me.
