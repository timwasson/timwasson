New love: Dodgeball. New hate: Bowling. 

I've been bowling since September now, and the "season" doesn't end until April 16th. I like bowling as much or more than the next guy, but c'mon.. I can't wait until I get my Monday nights back and I can be productive instead of bowling.

But Dodgeball rules. And with only 10 weeks in the season, it seems unlikely I'll get as burned out on it as I did with bowling.

In other news, I'm spending a little time every night getting my&nbsp; house in order, and hopefully at some point this weekend I'll be putting the "For Sale" sign in the front yard. It's kind of crazy to say goodbye to this home. A lot has happened in my life since I bought it, but I'm mostly ready to move on, I think.
