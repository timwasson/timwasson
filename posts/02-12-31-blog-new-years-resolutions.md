I do this about every year, and this year is no different.&nbsp;

**Lose Weight.** No shit, everyone has this goal. This year isn't spectacularly different from any of the other years I've tried and failed to lose weight, but I figure the battle has to be keeping my waistline in check a little bit, right?&nbsp;

**Blog more.&nbsp;**This blog is severely neglected, and blogging about my everyday goings-on is a good way to keep my memory as good as possible... which is still bad, by the way. But every little bit helps.

**Learn something.** In my field, if you're not learning, you're failing. I'm making strides with node.js and want to pick up some Ruby on Rails skills this year as well. Gotta keep up.

**Podcast.** I've started and failed at more podcasts than I care to admit, but 2014 is my year. I'll start a podcast and do... let's say, 20 episodes of one this year. Nothing helps with resolutions more than arbitrary number assignments.&nbsp;

**Side Projects.&nbsp;**I suppose blogging and podcasting could count here, but to be more specific about it, I want to get into a side project that is fun and that I learn from. I have no idea what that'll be as of now.

Other than that, life is pretty great. I have a great job, great family, and not a lot that needs improvement.&nbsp;
