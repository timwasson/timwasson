Not much to say today. I'm busy at work until noon, then it's off to my grandma's visitation. 

I just wanted to apologize for the comments left unanswered. We all know LJ's been screwy lately, and now on top of that, my work email isn't accepting outside email, which includes your comments. So, I have to look at my journal and read the comments the hard way, which sucks. The rumor is that our office email will be back up and running later today, but then again, I'll only be here 'til noon, so I won't see it.

That's all I have to say today.
