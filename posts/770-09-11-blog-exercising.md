So, this year has taught me a couple of things about my exercise regiment.

1. With my love of food and predisposition to be a little on the chunky side, exercise is a necessity for me to remain healthy. 

2. Without some amount of consistency in my schedule, I will not exercise. 

3. Exercise is considered a necessary evil in my life when I start doing it, but once its habit, I actually enjoy it.

4. A good exercise regiment also encourages me to eat better. If I'm going to spend all that time and energy running, why destroy that effort with a McDonald's double-quarter-pounder-with-cheese? 

Anyway, I can feel the exercise bug slowly starting to creep back up on me, and it feels fantastic. I've been up super-early every morning for a run around my neighborhood, but it didn't really start clicking until yesterday, when the cool morning air felt great in my lungs and the sweat felt great dripping off my forehead. Awesome.

I've been slowly increasing distance every day and I'm feeling great. I'll lose this weight just in time to gain it back for the holidays. Perfect timing.
