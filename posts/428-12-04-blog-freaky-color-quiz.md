I was reading [this girl's][1] journal and she mentioned [this quiz][2] and it's freaky results. Curiosity and boredom made me take a look, and here's my freaky real results.

Your Existing Situation  
Working to improve his image in the eyes of others in order to obtain their compliance and agreement with his needs and wishes

Your Stress Sources  
Feels trapped in a disagreeable situation and powerless to remedy it. Angry and disgruntled as he doubts that he will be able to achieve the goals and frustrated almost to the point of nervous prostration. Wants to get away, feel less restricted, and free to make his own decisions.

Your Restrained Characteristics  
Willing to participate and to allow himself to become involved, but tries to fend off conflict and disturbance in order to reduce tension.

Very exacting in the standards he applies to his choice of a partner and seeking a rather unrealistic perfection in his sex life.

Your Desired Objective  
Desires a tranquil, peaceful state of harmony offering quiet contentment and a sense of belonging.

Your Actual Problem  
Does not wish to be involved in differences of opinion, contention or argument, preferring to be left in peace.

Your Actual Problem #2  
Depleted vitality has created an intolerance for any further stimulation, or demands on his resources. A feeling of  
powerlessness subjects him to agitation and acute distress. Tries to escape from this by relinquishing the struggle, and by finding peaceful and restful conditions in which to recuperate in an atmosphere of affection and security.

This is freakily accurate, with the exception of the "acute distress" thing. I don't think I get distressed. I get pissed, but that's different. That "stress" thing started out right, but at the end it got weird. I feel unrestricted and free to make my own decisions already. 

Well, it's 4:40 which means time for me to leave early. yee haw.
