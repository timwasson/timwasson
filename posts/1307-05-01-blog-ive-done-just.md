I've done just about everything I know how to avoid doing work today. I worked on junkmachine stuff, watched some TV, took Abby on a walk, paid some bills, and set up an appointment to get my windshield fixed.

Now I'm out of stuff to do. Luckily it's almost 6, which means it's time for Just Shoot Me. Then I can make some dinner. Then Junkyard Wars. By 9, I may be ready for a few hours of real work.
