Last night was spent mostly trying to hunt down my friends. I couldn't do it. I wanted to go to Garner's, but everyone was inaccessible for one reason or another. 

I wasn't in the mood to make my own dinner, but unfortunately that was my only option. I started looking through all the cabinets in the apartment for some kind of food, but luckily the phone rang. It was Barb.

She invited me to dinner, and I accepted. It was a relatively uneventful dinner. She talked a lot about her dad, and spoke in very matter-of-fact terms about it. The conversation was filled with a lot of awkward silences, and then I started making stupid jokes to ease the mood a little. 

I feel sorry for her. I really do. I can't imagine what it's like to lose your father, but I'm hoping she doesn't expect me to be her best friend now. I just can't do that anymore. 

After dinner, I came home and killed some time watching Temptation Island and messing around on the internet, then I went to bed. It was really exciting. 

Tonight I get to draw naked people.
