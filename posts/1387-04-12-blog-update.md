Apparently I sent Angie an email I didn't mean to send. She replied, saying that she and Mullens had been keeping secrets from me, but didn't consider that to be lying, and she saw nothing wrong with that. I told her that there was a lot wrong with it, and she should have known that 1. I would find out and 2. that it would make things a lot worse in the long run.

So, she didn't apologize and again, just tried to justify what she and Mullens did. It's a shame. 

I actually prefer Mullens' method of just not ever trying to contact me.
