At around 3, my sister gave birth to a little baby boy. 8 pounds, 1 ounce. His name is John William Ziemba, but they're going to call him Jack. I should have some pictures to put up later tonight, but for now I got nothin'. I held him for a little while, and he is the cutest little guy ever. My mom said he acted a lot like me... not a lot of crying, but a lot of looking around and grabbing people's fingers. Anyway, so now I'm an uncle, and that's just exciting. I probably won't see him again while he and my sister are in the hospital, but I'll certainly go over and visit when they go back home, which should be Friday.
