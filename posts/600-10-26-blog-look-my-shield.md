Why do people feel the need to get so defensive? When I bring up topics I don't necessarily want a ton of feedback on them. When I feel a certain way, that's just how I feel and no amount of logic is going to change my mind.

I don't have many feelings, so when I get one, just let me have it, would ya? 

This gets especially harder when they're misunderstood to the point that I'm the bad guy. I don't want to be the bad guy, ya know? Especially not for something I can't control. 

Well, in other news, last night I ate home buffalo wings and drank some beer and watched some porno with some friends. It was all guys, of course, which was good because bitches woulda just cramped our style, yo. 

Tonight I'm hitting the bars for dollar draft and pizza night. It should be fun, provided I meet a bitch who will cramp my style, yo.
