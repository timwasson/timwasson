I was walking to Polk and Schwa about an Inspector Gadget toy I remembered as a kid. Well, I [found it][1] on eBay a few days back when the bidding was at like $4. I was all prepared to spend upwards of $30 to get it. However, I cannot justify spending more than $50, which is what the auction is at now.

Such is life. I'll keep my eyes open and try to get one out of the box or something. I want my toy!
