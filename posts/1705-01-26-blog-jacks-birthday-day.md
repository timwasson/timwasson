Instead of buying Jack a bunch of toys he'd use once and never again, Hillary and I took a different approach to his 8th birthday gift. We promised him a day full of whatever he wanted including a fancy dinner at Red Lobster and roller skating at the Peoria Palace.

We had a great time, even though he woke me up in the middle of the night to calm him down after a nightmare, and then wake us up again at the crack of dawn for breakfast.&nbsp;

I put the video from our day above, so you can watch Hillary knock over some random girl at the skating rink and see Jack fall over a handful of times. Overall it was a great day, and I think we've found a new tradition for our niece's and nephews' birthday parties.
