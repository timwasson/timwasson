Tuesday is the big day. I finish moving out, and financial responsibility begins. But, I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's take it from Friday evening when I left you.

I went home and did some packing on Friday, figuring I would pack until someone called me to do something, then go out. I knew not a lot was going on this weekend, and it would probably be spent watching rented movies with a friend or 2. So, I got a phone call from a friend and we decided to go eat dinner somewhere and watch a movie or something. He works 3rd shift though, so at about 9 he had to call it a night. I went over to another friend's house and watched a movie with her roommates as she spent the night on the phone and in her room. 

On Saturday I got up a bit early and packed some stuff. I took my huge TV to my new apartment, along with many other valuables. I unpacked what I could, which wasn't a lot. I only have one finished room, so I had to shove everything I own into that room or into my storage area. Hopefully when I get the carpet it will just be a matter of moving it 10 feet and calling it done.

Saturday night, we went to Damen's, which is a kick ass new restaurant/sports bar. They give you little hand held computers to play this quiz with other people eating, and you can also chat with them. So, me and him were chatting away with the people in the bar. It was really bizarre, since they knew who we were, and we had no idea who any of them were. They would make references to what we were eating and wearing, and we kept looking around to see who was saying these things to us. At one point a girl "VIXEN" asked me if I was hot. I said "I don't know... what do you think?" to which she replied "If you're wearing glasses and a black shirt you're hot. turn around and look for me". I didn't turn around, but I was pretty frightened.

After that we hung out at his place for a bit and headed to the bars. They sucked. There were a bunch of 26-30 year olds, and I felt a tad out of place. We had one beer and called it a night. I was home and asleep by midnight. 

Sunday I moved even more junk. I missed Simpsons. Then I went to sleep. Then I woke up and here I am. The end. That was my weekend. 

Next weekend will hopefully be a tad more eventful. In fact, I know it will be. We have all sorts of things planned for this week. Tuesday will be my first night in my new apartment, so some friends are staying the night with me. Wednesday is $3/lb. night at the best wings restaurant in the world, so we're having it delivered and watching movies. Friday is a chill night, with good friends only. We'll go out to eat and just chill in my apartment. Hopefully there will only be like 5 or 6 people there, tops. Saturday is my huge blowout party, with free beer and all sorts of people. It should be a lot of fun. 

That's about it for me. I'll probably type more later.
