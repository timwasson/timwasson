So I've decided that I need to copy Polk and have a LJ theme for a month. I've chosen the month of November for my first theme. For the month of November, each one of my entries will contain 1. A fact about myself that most people reading this won't know, and 2. one of my favorite memories ever from my extremely exciting life. I think that everyone on my friend's list should do the same thing. It will be mountains of fun.
