What weird timing. I just finished typing that last entry when one of my mom's friends spotted me at my shitty kiosk here in the mall. She walked up and asked me why I was selling phones when she always thought I was going to be a famous artist. Nice to hear I guess, but also frustrating because... well... I'm not one.
