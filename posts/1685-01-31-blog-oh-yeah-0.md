I love my milk. I love it. I have one glass when I go to sleep, and I chug out of the carton when I wake up. I also usually drink a few glasses during the evening. Well, I'm out of milk, so last night at 10:30 I was going to walk to Walgreens to pick some up. 

Well, at 10:30, Walgreens was closed. I thought it was 24 hours... I mean, aren't they all? Sure, I could have just walked across the street and gotten some from the grocery store, but if you do the math, you'll realize that's a whole extra 2 blocks. Screw that. I was tired.

So, I went home, skipped my nightly milk, then my morning milk. And now I have a horrible sore throat. I'm linking these 2 events together, even though they probably aren't linkable.

I need some milk.
