I had my first home cooked meal in a long time last night, thanks to Angie who made some weird cheese thing. And potatoes.

So the rumor is that Alan is going to buy the house next door. There's a lot of "ifs" that make the deal not a sure thing at all, but it's a definite possibility. Part of me thinks it would be awesome to have Alan next door, and the other part of me thinks it would be super sweet. Plans are already underway for an underground tunnel connecting the 2 houses, or possibly a large tube going over my driveway, similar to the ones at Chuck E. Cheese. I just hope he leaves the dog with his parents.

In an effort to buy everyone I know good Christmas presents this year, I'm really going to go hardcore with trying to get portrait jobs. Tonight I'm printing up some business cards and flyers and will give them to anyone who may have some sort of public bulletin board or something at their work to display them on. Also, I think tonight timwasson.com will turn into a temporary site for portrait related stuff. If I do enough this holiday season, I can not only buy neat stuff for everyone, but also maybe finish up paying off my credit card nonsense (down to $2700 because I rock).
