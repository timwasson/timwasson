This is on account of me not having a social life with all my friends still in school, having to study and other nonsense. 

Well, I was supposed to go help my aunt with her computer last night, which I didn't really feel like doing. Thankfully, she cancelled on me, so my night was free. Being Wednesday, it was Garner's night, so I went to the phone and started trying to get a hold of people. Right as I got to the phone, it started ringing. It was my aunt.

She didn't want me to come over, thank God. But, she did want to keep me on the phone for 45 minutes with stupid computer questions I've already answered. Do you have any idea how hard it is to answer these types of questions over the phone when you would rather just hang up and call your friends? Well, I did as best I could with her questions, which I don't think was very good at all.

So, finally the conversation ends, and I start going down the list of people I want to go to Garner's with. Everyone has already eaten by this point, or isn't hungry, or has to study, or blah blah blah. So I gave up, had 3 bowls of Frosted Flakes (they're GGRRRRREEEAT!), watched The Exorcist, fiddled online, drew some, then went to bed. It was great fun.

Tonight I get to draw naked people. Drawing is fun.
