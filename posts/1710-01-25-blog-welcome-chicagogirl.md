Chicagogirl is the latest person to add me to their friend's list without even telling me. For shame, Chicagogirl. 

I would go ahead and post a comment, but unfortunately it's all guys hitting on her, and I'm not really wanting to be a part of that whole scene. So, Chicagogirl, if you're reading this, here's your greeting.

You can see her journal, and the drooling boys, right [here][1].

And anyone else adding me to their friend's list, let me know, okay?
