My first day of work was really good. Everyone made it a priority to make me feel welcome and at home, which was a good change of pace from my last job. I think I'll really like it there.

After work, we headed to my grandpa's visitation. It was a really big turn out, which was nice to see, and I got to see a few relatives I don't see much. It's all unfortunate timing, with me missing my second day of work for a funeral, and me being all happy and excited about my new job before remembering how sad I should be because of the death of a family member. I keep going from really happy to sad, and then even a bit guilty for being happy in the first place. 

Anyway, that's about all I have to say about that. I'll post a big recap of work and the perks and whatnot once the funeral fun is over. In light of that, the work stuff seems significantly less important.
