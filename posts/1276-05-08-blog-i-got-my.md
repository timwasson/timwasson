I got my tax return last night. I'm $1600 richer now. It's like my birthday or something. I'm trying to decide what to do with this money I feel like I didn't even deserve. I'd really like a new DV camcorder, but I'm having a really hard time justifying that purchase. I'll probably use a few hundred bucks for some extra cushion between paychecks, and save the rest for a house I'll be buying when my lease expires. Ah, but that's boring stuff.

Steph will be coming home tonight, and I'm pretty excited about that. I probably won't get to see her, though. Her grandma died, and she's coming home for the funeral and various family activities. Tonight would be the only free night she has, and I've got my art class, and I'm sure she'll want to be with her mom anyway. This will postpone her plans to return home for the summer, but you gotta do what you gotta do, and I think this is a better reason to come home anyway.

But in other news, I didn't do much last night. I just watched Chasing Amy again with the commentary on, played with my retarded dog, and cleaned my room until I got bored with it.
