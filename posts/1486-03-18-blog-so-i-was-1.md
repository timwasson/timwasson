So, I was checking through my logs to see what kind of traffic junkmachine.com has been getting, and ran across something weird.

[http://www.zadara.cz/Programy%20internet/java_prog.htm][1]

I haven't the slightest idea what that page says, but it sure does link to junkmachine.com. Weird.

Traffic is okay on that page. It's getting better every day. Polk, you never told me what you thought of the All Alone cartoon.

My downpayment on the mosquito project should be coming within the next day or two. That will help immeasurably with bills and whatnot. 

In other news, I just learned that Iona, my former employer, has laid off 6 more people. Again, weird.
