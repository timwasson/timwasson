Ah, last night.

I got home and had a message to go to Angie's for a cookout. I decided I would go, as long as Steph was going too. So I called her up, and she met me at my place and we went to Angie's. Mullens and Fuller were also there, so that's 3 people total that I've had a falling out with and didn't really have any desire to talk to again. But you add enough beer to the equation and anything becomes a fun situation. I talked mostly to Steph, Fabish, and KJ, and I drank a lot of beer. At around 9, the 21 year olds were off to Lowry's for dollar bottle night, and those people were me, Fabish, Callahan, and Fuller. Conversation was pleasant, if not a little fluffy. I got good and drunk, but came back to my apartment earlyish... around 11:30 or so. 

I woke up really early this morning and got all ready for work, but then decided that I didn't really want to go. So I didn't. I called in sick, cashing in on some of the remaining 11 days I have left that I won't be reimbursed for after I quit. 

Fabish and I just went out to eat lunch at the New China Buffet. Good stuff.
