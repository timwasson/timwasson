A quick bit of Kouri's math for those interested:

Bill, $57 + Tip, $7. = $64 total.

Tim, $X + Jenny, $1 + Schwa, $7 + Brandon, $6 + Polk and Sarah: $15 = $29.

$64 - $29 = $35. 

Which means, of course, that the broke ass paid for every pitcher. That's the only way the math makes sense. I really need to get a damn job so I don't feel terrible for doing shit like this.
