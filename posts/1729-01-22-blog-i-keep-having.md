I keep having these dreams that I have to go back to high school for some reason, and I'm haunted by the things that really used to bother me in high school, but I've since learned that they're not a big deal. These include: forgetting my locker combination, having to sit by myself at lunch, forgetting "casual day" and coming to school in a uniform, and the list goes on. In real life, none of these would bother me anymore. In the dreams I've been having lately, they're like the worst things in the world.

Ah well. Today Alan is going car shopping and taking me with him. I'm driving, and Alan is giving me $8 for gas, which is nice. That will buy some more meals. I haven't been eating much lately.
