Last night I bought Gremlins and Poltergeist on DVD. I haven't seen either of them in probably 10 years. I was watching them last night, and it's bizarre the things I remember.

I remember little stupid things that have no relation to the plot at all. For example, in Gremlins I remembered the scene where they're behind the movie screen and you can see the shadows of all the Gremlins on the other side. In Poltergeist I remembered, and could even recite, the scene where they put the dead bird in the cigar box, and the part where Craig T. Nelson ties his tie into the phone cord, but I didn't remember the hand coming out of the TV, or the lady walking down the stairs. Weird. And the parents smoking pot as their kids slept? Was that in the version that I saw as a little kid? Anyway....

Yeah, that just about sums up what I've been up to the last few days... not much. 

Tonight Brian Kelly is supposed to come over, and we're going to order computer parts for my 'business'. 

13 working days left and counting....
