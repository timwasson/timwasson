Been having fun lately, but spending too much cash. Last night we actually went to a new bar called Centerfield 9. Then we went to Sully's. Then we went to Richard's. Tonight Mullens is having a part-tay at Anna's. It was supposed to be a pool party, but it looks like the weather had other plans. Maybe there will be women wandering around in bikinis anyway. I'm praying that's the case.
