Last night was super fabulous. Fabish's wife called me for the first time in history to invite me to their house for dinner. I brought some beer and we ate corned beef and cabbage, which was a first for me. And corn and mashed potatoes, but I had eaten those before.

We just dinked around and talked for a while, then Myra got there and we headed to Jimmy's. Fabish and Amy got in some fight about how he wouldn't be weirded out if Amy kissed another girl, and finally he just said "Okay, what do I need to say to stop this fight now?" It seemed pretty diplomatic. I was taking notes.

We also ran into Anna, Mullens' girlfriend, who gave us all sorts of updates about where he was and what he was doing. She's a nice girl.
