Hello to everyone who is finding me through the [Make Blog][1] or [Lifehacker][2]. I definitely appreciate the positive attention the little article has received, and I hope it helps someone else out there who has an iPhone with gray pixels. I've heard from a number of people so far that the pixels weren't dead, and may have been that the liquid in the LCD just wasn't spread out properly, or that there was condensation causing the bubbles, or dirt that was pressing on the LCD causing gray marks. I don't know about any of these, all I can report is that my technique (mostly) cleared up my problems.

I hope my experience helped someone out there. And now, here's a YouTube video from the first time a project I put out there got me some attention. Enjoy!
