Angie finally got back from Jamaica last night, so her and Mullens came over, made spaghetti, and watched a movie. Before they got there, I talked to Barb on the phone.

Here's the back story. 

Me and Barb have had differences in the past. Many, many differences. Enough differences that I decided it might be a good idea if we just called it quits and stopped seeing each other. Ever. Things were just too dramatic with her... never simple. I didn't have the time or energy to deal with it. 

After 2 years of not ever seeing me or talking to me, she starts trying to get back into my life again. I told her I wasn't interested and she didn't have to do that. I went so far as to accuse her of hanging on to her friends because she didn't have any left, and straight out telling her that I wasn't interested in seeing her. Things got weird again, and she started making bullshit accusations at me, saying things that weren't true or coming to the wrong conclusions about things I've done or said. I got pissed. I can't stand that. I yelled a lot and defended myself, all the while using it as an example of her not understanding where I was coming from or what I was about, and that's why maybe we should stop hanging out.

Well, then her dad died. She needed people to be there for her, and I was one of those people. I never had the intention of becoming her best friend again, but I wanted to be there for a rough spot in her life. 

She called me last night and said she wanted to get together so we could discuss something. Now, that's never, ever, ever a good thing. Ever. I finally got it out of her that it was about her issues during the time I kept pushing her away. For some reason, I'm kind of worried about what she has to say. I don't want her in my life anymore, but I also don't want to be the bad guy. I hate being the bad guy. If I make a break, I like it to be clean and mutual, not "I tried so hard but he's a dick", ya know? 

She's told me before how she tells stories to her friends about what a dick I am. She turns them against me for some reason beyond my realm of understanding. Maybe I shouldn't care, but I do. I HATE being the bad guy. I hate it.
