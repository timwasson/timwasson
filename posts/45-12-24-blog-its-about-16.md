It's about 16,000 degrees in my apartment right now. The heat is making me kind of tired, but not sleepy. If you were me, you'd know the difference between tired and sleepy.

So, that leaves me awake and bored at 12:30 on a Sunday night. Fabish and Alan are both out of town, so it really leaves me awake, bored, and alone at 12:30 with nothing to do. I don't really want to go to sleep, but damn it, I can't think of anything better to do.
