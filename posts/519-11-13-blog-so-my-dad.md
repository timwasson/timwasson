So, my dad and I took a look at that house and decided against it because of it's horribly poor and outdated electrical system. Since I will be using my home as a business as well, it's important to have reliable electricity. I can't risk having my computer blow up because of a short, ya know?

Anyhoo, that's about all I have to say today. I just went out and bought Swordfish and Dario Argenta's Suspiria, which I will watch and enjoy tonight.

Oh, yeah, that big CD-ROM project I was bidding so hard far... I was just called by the woman in charge who told me I am in the top 3 contenders for the project. She was going to call me yesterday and give the job to me, but then funding fell through on some other portion of the project, so she's once again out of money. Now it's just a waiting game.... I wasn't promised the job yet, but I think that fact that she almost gave it to me is encouraging. The project was planned to being on January 1st, which is still possible, but now unlikely. Ah well. I'm happy to be in the top 3 choices. I think that says a lot.

My dad took me out to lunch today. It was good. I like leaving the apartment.
