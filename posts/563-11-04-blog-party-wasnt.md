The party wasn't quite as horrible as I thought it was going to be. You get enough beer in the equation, and anything is fun, I guess.

Thankfully Mr. Bryan J. Polk stopped by and saved me from the conversations I would have had to have otherwise with the people there I didn't like much. We went through quite a bit of beer, and the apartment was trashed. As per usual, Fabish and I cleaned up the mess as Alan slept. 

Nothing too exciting happened at the party, I guess. Played some Asshole, and it was the first time I had ever been Asshole. Then I turned out to be Asshole 2 times in a row. Weird. 

That's about it, I guess. It was more uneventful than it was bad.

My parents just got done driving me around town checking out townhouses. Man, I can't wait to buy myself a townhouse. That will be pretty sweet. Although I need to figure out whether or not I'm staying in Peoria when my lease is up. I need to decide if and/or where I'm going within the next month or 2 to be prepared for whatever comes my way. Chicago? Milwaukee? St. Louis? Big cities are calling my name, I think.
