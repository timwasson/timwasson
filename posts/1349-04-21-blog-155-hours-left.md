15.5 hours left, everyone. That's right. I can, and AM, counting the hours at this point. 

Life is good. Life is great. Jaimee and my house look great. Not perfect yet, but hopefully perfect this weekend. The dogs are good. The friends are specular, and the life is great. Now all I need to do is get back on national television again and life will be perfect. Oh, and it would also be nice to have a PowerBook. Those are sweet, baby.
