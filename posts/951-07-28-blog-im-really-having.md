I'm really having trouble resisting the urge to get a sweet ass T-Mobile phone. Just minutes ago I even filled out my information on a site selling T-Mobile phones for cheap. I was a split second away from hitting that submit button. The weird thing is that I don't think I would have a hard time justifying 2 cell phones, but with Jaimee leaving, I'll actually have 3. And that's too many. 

Speaking of which, who wants Jaimee's LG 6000? It's going for around $200 on eBay, but I'd sell it to anyone reading this for $150. Or I'll give it to you if you do an assumption of service and take over the remainder of her contract. Or if you're a good friend, I'll loan it to you for a few months if you pay me for the service. I'm just not at all looking forward to dealing with that second line.
