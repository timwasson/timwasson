Man, I've been kickin' butt and takin' names when it comes to my new(ish) freelancing career. My March has so far been completely insane and, while I do finally see the light at the end of the tunnel and work letting up, it is also a scary proposition to be out of work again. But I'm still chugging along, keeping up with the work and keeping my clients happy, although at the same time missing precious hours of sleep and... ya know, a personal life.

I do have to keep reminding myself that I went freelance originally to straighten out my work/life balance and hopefully have a little more free time for personal projects. So far that hasn't worked out as well as I'd hoped, but I'm not one to complain about being so busy at such a horrible time in the economy. It feels good to finally be succeeding at this career at one of the hardest times to achieve it. It makes me really excited for the future.

But that's enough jibber-jabber about freelancing. Personally, life is also great. Great friends, great family, great soon-to-be-fiance, great dogs, great house. Life is good and keeps getting better.

My weight loss has been taking a back seat to life in general, but I'm back at it again, eating right and starting my running again. My legs hurt and a 3 mile run takes more out of me than it should, but it feels good to torture myself in this way and get back to the skinny Tim I used to know and love.
