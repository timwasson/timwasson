So yesterday I made the trek to Naperville to see Jaimee for the first time in 6 months. I was a bit worried things would be awkward or, at the very least, different. But they weren't. They were as good as ever. We watched some TV, saw a movie, and played in a park, just like old times. 

Today I'm crazy tired and will spend the remainder of the day working on my chair-ity chair. Exciting times, or something.
