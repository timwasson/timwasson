If the past few days have taught me anything, they've taught me that I have very little self control when it comes to not eating a bunch of crap. I love to eat. 

Because of this, I've decided to go against my better judgment and participate in round 2 of the Biggest Loser competition at work. This time, my goal is 15 pounds in 3 months as opposed to the goal of 30 I had before. With a bit of luck, I can get those 15 pounds knocked out pretty quickly, then spend some time maintaining and getting used to being a lesser weight. 

I plan to do this by keeping up with my diet/exercise regimine that treated me so well before, although I'll probably spend more time exercising and balance that out with barbeques and Better Cheddars. Next week I'm upping my running to 5 miles at a time, and lifting 4 days a week instead of 3. That should get me back on track. 

I got to eat dinner with my boyfriend Polk last night for the first time in a long time, and I ate 2 dinners. Then I went home, played Washers next door, and drank some beers. Good times.
