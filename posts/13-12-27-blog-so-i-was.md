So, I was really happy to get home last night. I was going to kick off my shoes, watch Fight Club, then go to sleep by 10. That was the plan, and the night I had been looking forward to for a long time, since I so rarely get enough sleep.

I got home and had 3 messages on my machine. One was from my sister, asking me to eat dinner at her house. I had just seen her on Christmas, so I felt no obligation to go over there again. I was going to call her, tell her how stupidly tired I was, and maybe get a pizza delivered or something. The others were both from Brice, my obsessive friend. 

I called back Brice first, and was going to tell him I didn't want to go to dinner or drive him to work, because tonight was my 'alone-time'. He asked me what I was doing for dinner and as I prepared my answer he said '...because I think we should go eat at your sister's." This really confused me. Apparently he had talked to my cousin, who was also invited to my sister's, and she said she was going. So, Brice asked me if I would go and take him so he could talk to her. I really didn't want to go. I wanted to watch Fight Club.

This next part of the conversation pissed me off even more. Here it is, almost verbatim.

Tim "All right, fine, I'll go to dinner tonight but I'm NOT taking you to work."  
Brice "Who's going to take me to work then?"  
Tim "I don't know"  
Brice "Oh."  
Tim "All right, well, I'll pick you up in like 25 minutes then"  
Brice"Wait, you're picking me up in 25 minutes?"  
Tim "yeah....."  
Brice "Is that when you're picking me up or you're ready to go?"  
Tim "Well, I just said I was picking you up in 25 minutes"  
Brice "Oh, well, I was wondering if you wanted to leave early and look at my new place."  
Tim "No."  
Brice"ha ha ha."  
Tim "...."  
Brice "Really?"  
Tim "Nope. See ya in 25 minutes"  
Brice "Dude, why are you so...."  
Tim "Yeah, whatever, see ya in 25 minutes."

My god, he's just so "gimme gimme". Earlier in the day I had to borrow $4 from him to pay for lunch and he gave me a hard time about it, meanwhile I've been hauling his dumb ass everywhere every day. Stuff like this makes me mad. I was obviously doing him a favor by going and he just kept asking for more. Eventually I drew the line and he got pissed. 

He was behaving himself nicely most of the night. He avoided talking about my cousin, which was good because he knows I hate that. The only other thing that pissed me off is when I asked him if he was ready to go, and he wanted to stay longer to talk to my cousin. He knew I wanted to get home and watch Fight Club and still he chose to talk to my cousin rather than half way accommodate the guy who went out of his way for him tonight. Or something. Whatever.

Anyway, I finally got home at about 8:30, and called Angie to bitch about Brice a little bit. Then I started Fight Club. The movie is really long, but I planned on watching the whole thing in one sitting. But, by 10:15 I was falling asleep so I was forced to turn it off and go to bed.

I slept like a baby. I didn't wake up at all in the course of the night, which never happens. I woke up more awake than I have in a long, long time. There's something to be said for this sleeping thing.
