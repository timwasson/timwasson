Today Dain came by and took me to lunch and to discuss the project I'm doing for him and Iona. I'm going to charge him more than I thought originally, because of all these change orders. It's making the project much, much longer than it should be. 

Tomorrow I should have a few more jobs tied up and in the bag, but my work day will be interrupted by my meeting with Jackie, who is going to set me up with a business and merchant account for my "business". Strange that in a matter of months I will have my own business, but kind of exciting, too. I also meet with my insurance guy for some reason or other... don't ask why yet, but I'm sure I'll give you the full report when I figure it out myself.

Next week I have to paint my sister's nursery and FINALLY start working on this business of mine. That's the plan, at least.

In my off time, I go to the couch and fall asleep. It's an exciting life.
