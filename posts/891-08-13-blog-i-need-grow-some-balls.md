I am not very eager to actually put money into a new business, since last time I did that, it was a disaster. I dropped nearly 5 grand on a company that's made me exaclty $17. So, lately I've been trying business things that take no money. The Bruce/Sam VCD is a good example, and I'm riding high on the success of that experiment.

But, I want to try it again. I want to invest money into a "business" and make it work. I like my job and all, but I don't like going in every day. I want to do my own thing.

Anyway, I've run across another business idea I'm seriously considering. It will take an investment of somewhere between $300-$600. Between my new job at the gallery, the VCDs, and a couple of recent freelancing gigs, I've had a stellar couple of weeks and have the money to spare. But, it's still a risk, and with the loss of $5K still in the back of my mind, I'm having a hard time goin' for the gold.

I should really just get over it. I mean, sure, I lost 5 grand, but I learned a lot. And I lost the 5 grand almost half a year ago. It's time try something new. People are starting to laugh at me when I mention new business prospects, but I don't care much. I am bound and determined to someday work for myself and not for someone else. I don't like working for other people. It sucks. 

Anyway, the $5K loss is still haunting me, which is kind of the reason I'm reluctant to lose more money on a business that's not a sure thing. I still have credit card bills that I racked up because of that $5K. Every time I look at my bill, I'm reminded of my failure. But the moderate success of my VCD thing makes me really want to try again.

My new business experiment involves me buying a box of various electronics, seperating the contents, and selling them individually. It's kind of hard to explain, but I'm pretty sure I could make money selling this stuff on eBay. If eBay has taught me anything, it's that there's someone out there who will buy whatever it is you're selling.
