So, there's 3 days left until Christmas, and I really couldn't care less. When I was a kid, I used to get so excited and I'd look forward to Christmas for months. Nowadays it's just another day. That's a shame. I get more excited for Halloween than Christmas. I guess I'm just getting older. Too bad.

Lunch with Missy was uneventful. We just caught up on the last 5 or 6 months we haven't seen each other, and after lunch we went our seperate ways. I probably won't see her for another 5 or 6 months. 

Yesterday was my dad's birthday, so we went out to eat. After that, Robert and I went shopping for a digital camera that he could use for his kid. Then Robert and I had to go out to my parent's house to help my dad move an engine from garage to garage. After that, Robert, Sarah and I all went to see Lord of the Rings, which was very, very good. I didn't even notice that it was like 3 hours long.

Today is Christmas on my mom's side of the family. I'm not looking forward to it. I still have shopping to do before I head off.
