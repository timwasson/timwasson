So, Nintendo Computer Part II is almost finished. This one was actually harder to do than the first. But it will be way cooler.

Today Jaimee was sick, so I went over there to visit for a while. I just signed up to be a mystery shopper, and my first assignment was Hooters. I got this big long survey thing to fill out, and had to really prepare before placing my order and picking it up. But, it was a free lunch and totally worth the extra effort. I'm also hoping to mystery shop Chili's, Damon's, and other various restaurants that I want to eat at but am too poor.

Not much else interesting going on, I guess.
