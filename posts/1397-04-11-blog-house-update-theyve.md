House update: They've all but accepted our offer on the house. It's pending approval on estimated closing costs, which they should have by this afternoon. Then, hopefully, they'll accept our offer and we'll have a closing date soon. It was a pain, but it's all coming to a close, and it will hopefully all be worth it in the end.

I'm still waiting to hear about The Screen Savers. I want to call and ask about the status, but I don't want to annoy the poor producer I've been annoying so far.
