Okay, yeah, comments are back with a vengeance, arriving with the power of AJAX, which means less page refreshes. Coming up, even FEWER page refreshes! Sweet! It's so exciting, I know. So leave me comments to make sure this whole deal works. It should. 

Anyway, I took the leap today and bought me a MacBook. Why? Well, there's a change a-brewin', that's why. With change comes fun, with fun comes toys, and WOW, it's all so exciting I don't know quite what to make of it all! Okay, so that's an exageration, but hell, things are good and soon enough I'll be going through a big change in my life. I don't want to get too specific just yet. 

Anyway, back to the site news. Comments are functional, archived posts still are not. I also need to work on an RSS feed. It'll be a busy weekend.
