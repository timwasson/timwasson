I'm babysitting my nephew as I type this, but he's mumbling under his breath and jumping around wildly as he plays Lego Star Wars, so I bet he won't even notice I'm typing away on my blog.

Last week I hit a huge speed bump in my freelancing career. While I've had bad days before, I've never had a time when I regretted freelancing or wishing I was back at a "regular" company. Until last week. A server that I use for most of my really good clients crashed, and crashed hard, for several days. I not only dished out some monetary credits to my customers for their inconvenience, but I also took three days out of my schedule to get them moved over to an actually active server.

As I moved files, backed up databases and swapped around DNS information and configuration files, I couldn't help thinking, in the back of my head, that maybe freelancing was a stupid career choice. The crisis turned what was going to be a very good April, financially speaking, into a barely adequate one because of the credits dished out and the work lost. And honestly, I'm a computer nerd by necessity, not really because I love computers. I DESIGN websites, but this server nonsense is stuff I leave in the hands of professionals and I hate doing it myself. And yet, here I was, for 3 days straight dealing with this stuff exclusively. I thought freelancing was supposed to help me be more selective about the jobs I took, not less.

In the end, as the servers came back online and I was actually able to get a full night's sleep again, I realized that this is one of those hits you take when you're your own boss, making your own way in the world and acting as a 1-man company. Sometimes it's about doing things you don't feel like doing in putting in stupidly long hours&nbsp; to solve problems that weren't your fault. But then, other times, it's about taking a Monday off to baby sit your nephew. It's a great career and after doing this for the last 7 months exclusively, I can't picture myself doing anything else. Except illustration.
