I stayed up way too late watching Predator 2 and working on stuff for Iona and junkmachine last night. I'm crazy tired today, and to top it off, I didn't bring any change for soda. So no caffeine for me.

I always get a kick out of the text at the bottom of spam that tells a story or just mentions people's names to get around spam filters. I just got some spam selling illegal software, and here's the story at the bottom:

"Henrys amazement was also great, especially when he spotted the two elders from his church. Slade, mandy said quietly, im glad mum let me talk to you. I mean, most of the congregation are at work on tuesday morning. Behind her there was a sudden uproar as all the people started talking at once."

Beautiful.
