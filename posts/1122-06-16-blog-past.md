For the past 2 nights, I've gone to bed around 10:30, and woke up around 4:30, completely awake. I find it pretty difficult to get back to sleep. That's around 6 hours of sleep, I guess.

My dad gets by with 6 hours every day. Maybe I can too. Maybe this is those energetic vitamins working their magic. Or maybe I've been so drowsy all the time because I'm forcing myself to sleep too much.
