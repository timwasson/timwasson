One of these days, I'm going to start a blog entry without apologizing for lack of blog entries. It's been a common theme of mine to always start off after a long absence with an apology, and today is no different. I've been slacking. I apologize.

But man, life has been busy since getting married, in a good way. Work slowed down to almost a halt upon our return to Illinois, but has picked back up to the point that I can barely keep up. I go from frantically busy to waiting for client feedback to frantically busy again, but I'll tell you what, this is a great life I'm leading. A wonderful house, a fantastic wifey, 2 mostly obedient dogs, and a one-man-show business that is doing just fine despite the slow economy. It's as close to the American dream as I can think of. I spend a good chunk of almost every day appreciating how good I have it.&nbsp;

And since our friends and loved ones (mostly) already know our plans, I'll put them on here for the whole world, too. The wife and I are considering a big move. Actually, let me rephrase that... we've considered a move, and decided to do it. All systems go. Not a move to Bloomington or Springfield, although those were discussed, but a move to London England.

Social workers are in high demand there, so I'm more than willing to ride my wife's coat-tails all the way to Europe. It would only be for a year since those are the Visas that are required/available, so we'd be back in Peoria before we knew what hit us, in time to see my nephews and niece grow up without missing too much. There's a lot of hoops to jump through and things to consider, and we're far from a done-deal on the relocation, but we're on our way and that's what matters.
