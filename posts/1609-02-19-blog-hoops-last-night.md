Hoops last night for the first time in a long time. I love Hoops and I love the pizza and on Wednesday, I love the price. Jaimee and I got out for $12 which included 2 beers, 2 sodas, and 4 slices of the world's greatest pizza. Plus an encounter with the drunkest man with the hugest scar I'd ever seen. Or not.

Today is the big day. My sister is having her second son and my second nephew today. The name is still a secret. She's in the hospital right now, but I don't know much else about the status. I was promised updates today, so you'll know when I do. 

I'm hungry.
