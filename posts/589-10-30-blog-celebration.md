In celebration of the perfect day today (can I get an agreement from the locals?), I did a shitload of yard work, including raking up the leaves I'd let sit on my lawn, keeping the moisture in to help spawn the growth of my new grass. I raked it up, and what did I see? New grass, baby. Not a lot. Little blades here and there. Not at all even or smooth or consistent, but definitely more grass than I had before. 

It's good to make new life.

I missed the 3rd anniversary of this here LJ. And with the 3rd anniversary, I'd like to share with you a story of me, an illustration position, and how this LJ both ruined it and saved my whole life at the same time.

So I posted a lot about this company and how I had 3 interviews and made it to the final selection out of 80 candidates, and I was all excited to get a job in my field and make good money again. Well, in a bizarre twist of fate, the company found this LJ, and although I didn't post anything sensitive, decided to not hire me. At first I was devastated. Completely crushed. I had made it... out of 80 candidates, I was 1 of 3 that was good enough to get onboard. And something so silly and innocent had ruined it, and it was my fault. 

In the days and weeks that followed, I decided it was the best thing to ever happen to me. Completely a blessing in disguise. I've never felt like God helped me out as much as He helped me out of that potential horrible situation. They were corporate Nazis. I met a guy who knew a bunch of people who worked there, and they were all miserable and wanted to leave, but were stuck because of no-compete and non-disclosure statements. They kept their employees by keeping them scared, not keeping them happy. They used business practices which were a bit shady. People came out of the woodwork to tell me how horrible it is to work for that company. They have talented people and make good shit, but I wouldn't want to work there. And I'm glad I'm not. 

So there's the whole story about how LJ contributed to the best and worst thing to happen to my career this year. I ended up never being sued, although it was a threat for a while. The end.
