The weekend had its ups and downs, but was okay when everything averaged out. 

Winnie got sick and some bad looking patches on her, so after a vet bill and $120, we have a bunch of pills to feed her to make her better. She's already looking much more chipper, although she's napping more often and tends to lay on the floor and look at me like she's miserable. Poor little sweetheart.

After my meeting at Iona, I went home and ate dinner. A little while later I went to Jimmy's for a couple drinks with Mullens and, later, Angie. Tonight is a meeting with a financial advisor, then out to my parents' house, then home to work on the Iona projects. It's going to be a fun night.
