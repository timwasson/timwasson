As uneventful as this weekend was, I feel the need to update you.

Friday, did nothing.  
Saturday, went to see Unbreakable, then did nothing.  
Sunday, did laundry and cleaned.

Yee haw. Why did I clean all day on Saturday? Go ahead, ask me. Well, I cleaned because I'm having some people over. Who, you ask? Nurses. The entire nursing class at Bradley is coming to my apartment to drink beer tonight. Today is their last final, and they need to celebrate, but don't have a good place to do it. All of their roommates are busy studying for their finals, so they're coming over to my place. It should be awesome. 

Of course, today we got about 400 inches of snow, so that may put a stop to our plans.
