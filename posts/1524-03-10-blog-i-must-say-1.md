I must say, that little operation fucking sucked ass in every conceivable way. 

I opted for an IV rather than just gas or local, because I'm a huge pussy. The doc assured me I wouldn't feel or remember a thing, but he was mistaken. I was out like a light, but I woke up in the middle of it to pulling on my tooth and the doctor giving instructions to the nurse. It hurt, but not much. A few seconds later, it hurt like a son of a bitch. I made a little grunt noise, heard the doc give the instructions for more medication, and went back under. That happened once or twice until I finally woke up to more pulling and prodding and drilling and the doc assuring me it would be over soon. I knew I wouldn't be getting anymore medication, so for the last tooth I just kind of had to deal with it. The crunching, drilling, tugging, clamping stuff all fucking sucked. He told me it was the worst one he's taken out this year, due to my twisted roots or some such thing. I was awake the entire time he stitched up my gums. It felt exactly like you'd think it would, and it fucking hurt.

Now my throat hurts and every once in a while, so does my mouth. My lips hurt more than my teeth do.

And with that, I'd like to run down a list of thank yous. Thanks to Angie who picked me up, waited with me, drove me home, and picked up my Vicodin. Thanks to Mullens for bringing a chocolate shake. Thanks to Alan for bringing movies for me to watch. Thanks to Emily for making me Jello to eat. Thanks to my parents for seeming a little too worried about me. And now, I'm going to waste the rest of the day with ice packs on my face and frequent trips to the potty.
