I'm skipping work to go "hang out" at another potential place of employment. Is that really wrong? Maybe, but I don't care.

I did some work today. No matter that it wasn't important or necessary... it helped pass the time. Hopefully "hanging out" won't take long tonight, and I can get some hot wings, drink some beer, and sleep in my apartment. Yee haw.
