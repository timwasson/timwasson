Peoria is having a damn blizzard right now. The roads are horrible since I'm pretty sure Peoria doesn't own any snow plows or anything. Cammy would not have made it to work this morning. My Jeep, however, made it just fine. I slapped it into 4 wheel drive and made my way in without a hitch. Go Jeep.

It made me feel a little better about giving Cammy up.
