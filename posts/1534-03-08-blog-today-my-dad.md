Today my dad took me out to lunch and gave me some extra cash so money isn't quite as tight now. That's a good feeling... knowing I can spend a little money on groceries or pay more than the minimum on my credit cards.

I took Abby to the park and printed up some junkmachine.com promotional material at good 'ole Kinko's.

It seems like I started this post intended to post something interesting. But I can't remember what that was.
