Well, 2007 is already off to a great start for my inner tech geek. As expected, Apple released their iPhone... kind of. It doesn't actually hit the streets until June, so I guess it's time to start saving my pennies and bracing myself for the move to Cingular. 

I'm not particularly interesting in the Apple TV for some reason. The Mac Geek inside me should have already bought it, but it doesn't do anything my media center doesn't do. Plus I don't have a HD TV to take advantage of the cool stuff. Maybe that should be my next purchase, huh?
