What a weekend. Friday after work I took Winnie to the vet for her annual check up and shots and to have her breathing checked up on. I have to take her back for X-Rays next week, which sucks. 

That night was Kouri's with the regular crew, plus John Zarr, a buddy of mine for many years. 

Yesterday was Callahan's wedding, which was uneventful for the most part but very nice. 

Today my parents took me and the 'ole lady out to lunch at Red Lobster. Now I need to do some cleaning and working on Optimus and watching a special 90 minute AFV. Good times.
