As promised, below are 4 photos to make up for the entries without them. 

On Christmas night, Wolfie was the only one who called interested in keeping up with the Hoops tradition, now 3 years strong. We called it a night early so he could go see The Life Aquatic and I could go to sleep. I'd had a big day. 

The next day was spent sitting around a lot, then helping Angie hang a mirror and replace her thermostat before meeting Wolfie for Darkness. Now let me just say that I love virtually all horror movies, but this one sucked. I can't imagine anyone enjoying this movie, especially the ending. Besides Anna Paquin being extremely easy on the eyes, I can't think of one redeeming quality about this piece of crap flick. Don't even bother when it's on TBS really late one night with nothing else on. There's my review.

After that was more sitting around, a little laundry, and a little iPod tomfoolery before going to dinner and out for a few drinks with Angie, followed by Shrek 2, which was very enjoyable. 

Today I ran some errands and stopped by to see Mullens' progress on his basement bathroom, and now I'm going to do a little more sitting around. I love days like this. Back to work tomorrow for a 3 day work week.

**Dad, Peter, and Sarah**  
I think I caught Peter mid-sneeze with this one. I don't know what everyone is looking at so closely, but I suspect it was Jack being cute and/or funny.

**The Whole Family**  
Yes, the Wasson Morning Christmas reached a whopping 7 people this year since my sister had another kid. For those out there in LJ land who always wondered what the rest of the folks looked like, there's everyone.

**Jack at the speed of light**  
Jack played Santa this year, passing out all the gifts to everyone. Here he is, obviously on a mission, moving so fast my camera could barely keep up with him.

**Jack with my mom's present**  
Like all good parents, my sister gave everyone presents this year "from" Jack and Peter. They didn't know what they had given, obviously, so this is Jack getting clued in to the present he gave my mom.
