I'm into my last 2 weeks at work now and hating every minute of it. My last 2 weeks will be spent almost exclusively at Northwoods, including an 11 hour shift on Wednesday. Which sucks.

So yesterday I went out with Wolford and Jaimee to dinner at Agave. After that, Jaimee went home and Wolford and I went to see Hellboy, which pretty much kicked all sorts of ass.

I'm really, really, really looking forward to my little vacation in between jobs. I'm going to do yard work and all sorts of other productive stuff around the house. I may even re-activate one of my credit cards so I can afford some home improvement projects. That sounds like the best idea I've had all week.
