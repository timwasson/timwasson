I bought a stupid toy. I'm so lame. I've been so good for months now, eating out less than usual, buying virtually no DVDs, and basically only the essentials for about 3 months now. But last night, I found a good deal on this awesome digital camera/digital camcorder/MP3 player/voice recorder, and I had to buy it. [Here's][1] what it looks like. 

Not much else to report. Going up on Friday to see Jason X with Jaimee and Wolford and possibly Toni. I'm ridiculously excited about that stupid movie.
