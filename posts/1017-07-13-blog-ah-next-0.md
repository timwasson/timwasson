Ah, the next few days will be filled with rain and thunderstormy goodness. I'm so excited, as is my grass and plants. 

I've spent the last few days basically working myself into a stupor. Between the new floor installation in my office and spare bedroom, combined with re-filling and re-organizing the rooms and trying my best to clean other areas of my house at the same time, I haven't had a spare second. Oh yeah, and I also haven't been slacking on my running duties, which are almost always followed by walking my dog. I've been so worn out at the end of the day, but hopefully by the end of the weekend my life will be back sorted out and I can get on with the standard monotony of it all. That's my goal anyway.
