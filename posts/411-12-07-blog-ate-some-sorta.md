[<img src="http://pics.livejournal.com/wasson/pic/000076q0" alt="120704_175300.jpeg" border="0" align="right" />][1]Ate some sorta homemade lasagna yesterday, then finally saw National Treasure. The movie was pretty good, the meal was really good. Then I came home and worked on portraits and watched The Biggest Loser. This is a boring entry, but I doubt anyone will read it since I'm editing a 12 hour old one. Such is life.
