Ah, ringing in the new year. A fresh start. A new beginning. Its a time to plan your goals and start your resolutions and get one step closer to being that guy or girl you want to be. My resolutions are pretty simple, really. Run a marathon, finish more projects I start, and try to be a better person to everyone in my life, because most of them deserve it. 

Anyway, 2006 was rung in by eating dinner with the Mullenses then going to Alan's party at his house. Good times were had, many beers drank, many stories told, and just an all-around fantastic night. The rest of the weekend was spent doing nothing in particular, outside of an 8 mile run, some little chores and errands, and a bunch of movie-watching. Hope everyone's new year was splendid.
