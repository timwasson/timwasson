I finally got my awesome camera thing. You can see pictures I took with it [here][1].

It's been a productive few days. I got a new job here in town which starts soon. I also got [Joy's message board][2] working on the [junkmachine servers][3]. And, if that wasn't enough, put a [conspiracy page][3] up on junkmachine. Plus I'm working on a new cartoon.

My mom's birthday is today, so yesterday me and my sister went out to buy her presents. It's odd how little time my sister and I spend together considering how close we live. We just don't have a lot in common, and our family isn't very close anyway. 

Today I wrote up some contracts and delivered them and got a down payment on a job I've got lined up. I also ate at McDonalds, which I haven't done in a long time. 

In 3 weeks, I will be homeless for 10 days. I'm kind of looking forward to it in a weird way.
