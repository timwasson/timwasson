I've been learning a lot lately about jQuery, and in an effort to learn more I put together a couple Github repos that may be useful. The first is a fixed-menu scroller. They're all the rage these days. As the menu hits the top of the screen, it stays there. As the sections scroll underneath, the menu highlights the active section. I also threw in a bit of smooth scrolling. It's all in one easy-to-implement package. Sprinkle in a touch of CSS transitions, and you've got yourself a super-fancy and super-easy fixed menu scroller.

Check it out [here on Github][1].&nbsp;

I also put together the [world's simplest accordion][2], 'cause if there's one thing the world needs it's more jQuery accordions.&nbsp;
