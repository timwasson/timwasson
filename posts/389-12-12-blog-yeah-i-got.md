Yeah, I got sick. I spent the majority of the day fighting off a sore throat, headache, fever, and any other symptom you could think of. Then at around 10, I started puking everything that I had eaten that day. Today, I feel pretty much A-OK... I still have a bit of a sore throat, but otherwise I'm fine. It must have just been a 24 hour thing.

In other news... well, I guess there is no other news.
