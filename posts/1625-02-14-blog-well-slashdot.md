Well, the slashdot madness still isn't dying down. Hits are back up today, and I don't know if that's from slashdot or another page that linked to me. I'll find out tomorrow. I put up a desperate link, begging for money because I'm so far over my transfer limit, and broke. We'll see if anyone replies. I've also put my NESPC back on eBay, because I think with all the hype, people are willing to pay more. We'll just have to see. Things are weird right now in the world of junkmachine.com.
