It was a good weekend for me. 

On Friday, I went right from work to Fabish's parent's place to eat dinner with him and his family to celebrate his 21st birthday. It was a good time. On Friday, Brice and some friends were supposed to come over as a last kind of party with the guy before he leaves, but at the last minute, Fabish got someone to work for him, so he ended up with the night off. Since it was his 21st and all, I thought I should go out to the bars with him, and leave the Brice party for Saturday. So, we did. Brice came along of course, as did Smalley and Brian Kelly, 2 friends of mine from high school that I don't get to see very much. We hit a few bars, including a new one named Roxy's, which was very nice. I ran into a lot of people I knew from high school in there. That was a little strange, but I digress.

So anyway, I didn't get in until around 4 on Saturday morning, so I slept a lot on Saturday. Brice spent the night since he drank himself stupid on Friday, and spent a good long time puking in my front lawn and bathroom. 

Saturday night Jamie came over, as did Steph and Brice, and we hung out for a while but Steph had to leave early. At around 10, me, Alan, Jamie, and Brice went to the Jukebox comedy club. That was fun, since Jamie and I both knew a guy who works there who got us in for free. After the show, we went back to visit with him, and we all got to hang out in the backstage area with the 2 comics who just performed. The headliner had been on Leno, Letterman, and opened for Drew Carey on occassion. He was a really nice guy, but kept trying to get me to buy one of his CDs. 

After that, we went to a kegger that one of my friends, Emily, was having. It pretty much sucked, and we were only there to say hi. We went back to my place, played cards, listened to some music, and I went to bed earlier than any of the rest of them, at around 3:30. 

Sunday, I went down to visit my grandma. That was a sad visit, so I'll leave it at that.

Why is it that during the work week, I can't think of anything I want to do more than move away, and yet, during the weekend, I can't think of any reason why I should? Weird.... But, in thinking about it more, I may stick around until January. It would be my last holiday season with the family, plus I'd get to see my new niece/nephew be born. I think I would feel horrible if I missed that. I'd feel less bad about leaving my roommates, and if I move to LA, it would be my last chance to see snow and have it be cold. That's probably what I'll end up doing.
