I met with the insurance adjuster man today. He was a nice guy with a terrible toupee. Just as I suspected, the costs of a new window/top turns out to be... well, a lot. He does have to adjust for depreciation, which I think is lame and stupid. I mean, just because my top is 5 years old doesn't mean a new one costs less, right? Right? Right?

Anyhoo, so the check is coming soon, I hope. I don't know how much I'll get yet. I hope it's enough because I'm broke as shit.
