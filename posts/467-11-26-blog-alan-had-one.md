Alan had one of his shitty parties on Saturday night, so I locked myself in my bedroom to get away from all of them. Abby and I just tinkered around on my computer and played Game Boy Advance all night. Those batteries last forever.

Sunday Simpsons wasn't on because of Episode I. God, I fucking hate that movie and I hate George Lucas like you wouldn't believe.

Mullens and I went to Hooters on Sunday and were waited on by a girl I know through Fabish. That was a bit awkward to say the least.

And now it's Monday and I will spend today working hard on this stupid project to get it out of the way. I have until Friday to finish it up. It's going to be a tight finish.
