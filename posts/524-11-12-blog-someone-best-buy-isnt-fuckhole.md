Finally! Justice has almost been served! After a battle with Best Buy lasting more than a year, I finally get a call from someone who wants to help me out. A guy named Brad McCoy called me today regarding my latest Best Buy complaints, asking me to send him the rainchecks I received. He's going to show them to someone in charge and either get me a gift certificate or actually redeem the rainchecks. 

Best Buy still sucks, but suddenly they suck a lot less.

Also, Pearl Jam's latest album comes out today. I recommend you go pick it up.
