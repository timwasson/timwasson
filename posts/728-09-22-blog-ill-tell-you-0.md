I'll tell you what. Last night rocked my nuts off. I went to Kouri's, otherwise known as the best restaurant in the world. It was a beautiful night, and Mel was our waitress and Jen was a fellow customer. Some pitchers of beer, some hot wings, some good conversation and male bonding. It all added up to a good 'ole time. 

Afterwards, I stopped by Angie's for a bit. Then took my dog for a short walk. Before hand, I lifted a bunch of weights and rode a long ways on my recumbant bike. 

For the past few months, I've been migrating back to my desktop PC from my laptop. I don't know why, exactly. Last night, I think my monitor broke. And now, a moment of silence for my monitor and a little story about it. 

I was in my 2nd year at the Institute of Art in Chicago, working on one of my animation finals on my computer when my monitor fizzled and died. Thankfully, I had my car up with me, so I hopped in and headed for Best Buy (this was before they were off-limits). I picked out the cheapest, yet largest, monitor I could find and shoved it as best I could into my trunk, then headed home. I had to parallel park without the ability to see through my back window. Once I was out of my car and had unloaded the monitor, I realized how far away I was from my apartment. Driving to Best Buy didn't really save me any time at all, and only took off about 2 blocks of my total distance. I had to lug this enormous thing back to my apartment. The experience took 2 or 3 hours, start to finish. 

That was nearly 5 years ago, so I suppose its time to retire the beast. Such is life. 

It could also be a bad video card or cable, however. A bit of trouble shooting is in order, but I'm kind of excited to buy an LCD monitor.
