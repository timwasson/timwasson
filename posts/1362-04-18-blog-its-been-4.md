It's been a productive day. I went out to put my downpayment down on my new apartment. Unfortunately, it does not have 2 balconies. I also drove by the building last night and noticed that, since my apartment is on the top floor, it may have cathedral ceilings. Unfortunately, it doesn't. She did let me see the actual apartment, however, which was rough. They had ripped off all the walls and were installing new drywall. 

I also finished up these t-shirts I was doing for a client, which I haven't been motivated to do lately. Now I'm going to do a bit more work, and hopefully get around to updating junkmachine with the SexSexWorld stuff, just for you, Polk.
