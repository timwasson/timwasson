So I downloaded a bunch of Strokes songs, and I must say they kick ass. I recommend them to everyone reading this right now.

It's been an uneventful few days. I applied for a full time job as a comic book artist. I almost certainly won't get it, but it would be totally cool if I did. 

I'm hard at work with this mosquito thing in the hopes that I'll get the Alpha CD out tomorrow, leaving a few days off that I can work on my own thang... a timwasson.com renovation as well as many junkmachine.com updates. Exciting times.
