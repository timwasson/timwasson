Me and Fabish ate at Dynasty Buffet yesterday. God, I love that place.

A few days ago I applied for a job at Dynamic Graphics. I hear lots of horrible things about the place, but on the other hand, I need money. With Alan moving out soon, there's pretty much no way for me to be able to afford a house all by my lonesome without borrowing ridiculous amounts of money from my dad. So, I'm kickin' it up a notch in the career search.

Truth be told, trying not to be cocky or anything, I'm way overqualified for the position I applied for. But, I've also done some research into the place, and I know I'd advance quickly and get paid a lot within a relatively short time frame. I dropped off my resume a couple days ago and followed up with a phone call just a few minutes ago. They've stopped collected resumes, and mine was one of the ones forwarded to the hiring manager. It was encouraging that I only needed to say "Hi, I'm Tim Wasson..." before she knew exactly who I was and what I was calling about. She must have looked the the resume a little closer than some people's.

So, I've been instructed to call back next Friday and see about an interview. My impression was that all the applicants forwarded to the hiring manager would be interviewed, but I don't know. I kind of get the same feeling about this job as I did when I applied for Iona... I know I'm exactly what they're looking for, and I know if I get an interview I'll get the job. I'm not so sure I want to go back to a full time, 9-5 job... in fact, I'm sure I DON'T want to, but 2 years as a freelancer and still strugglin' means maybe I'm not right for a freelancing career. I've found it to be increasingly difficult to get out there and look for jobs, send out demo reels, make cold calls, etc. So, my career plans have been altered. 

1. Get a well paying job that continues to put food on the table and pay my mortgage (that sounds weird).  
2. Spend my free time trying my damndest to set up some sort of business (don't know what yet, though) that I love to do.  
3. Hopefully, let my business blossom into something that can put food on the table and pay my mortgage.

Basically, it's exactly what my dad did. It took him 7 or 8 years to get enough business and enough notice to actually live off what he makes in his side business. Unfortunately, he's also really close to retirement and doesn't want to blow his retirement money. I figure I'm 23, and in 8 years I'll be 31. Hopefully I'll have the balls to up and quit again, but hopefully this time I'll have a business that is already doing well for me instead of just jumping in head first without the slightest idea on how to succeed. I don't know. We'll see. And if I hate Dynamic Graphics as much as I think I possibly will, then I can keep looking for more multimedia jobs, put my degree to work for me, and just look at the bright side of the situation: I'm not a broke ass, I have health insurance, and I can afford a sweet ass motorcycle. 

Anyway, all that is a moot point because I haven't been interviewed, don't have an interview set up, and may not get the job at all. And yes, I'm already putting my eggs in 1 basket and thinking about what I'll do with the extra money, what debts to pay off first, and how great it'll be to be debt-free and have extra money, as well as health insurance and other good good goodies. So there's an update on my career. I hope you've enjoyed it.

Last night I went out for a drink with Dayv and Jenny, and was later joined by Mr. Bryan J. Polk hisself. And I see him again tonight. That's twice in a week, which has to be some sort of record.
