Okay, the weekend, from the top.

Friday night, Missy and Jill came over to watch a few movies. We watched The Usual Suspects and Can't Hardly Wait, then they left. It was an uneventful night, at best. 

Saturday was the first time in a long time I've had the oppurtunity to drink, since I was on medication from strep throat. During the day, me and Alan went down to Bloomington for this 'super sale' thing. They were selling all sorts of electronics and stuff, but most of it was crappy, and the prices were not as spectacular as they had advertised. We left, disappointed, and neither of us bought anything. That night, Alan, Brice and I went to Hooters, where we ate hot wings and hamburgers. Then we came back to my place and drank beer and watched a movie.

Sunday I spent a few hours tweaking my remote control and watching The Neverending Story, which was way more depressing than I remember it being when I watched it as a kid. I watched Simpsons and Jackass as per usual. Nothing too astonishing happened on Sunday.

And now I'm here at work. It's been raining for the past 3 months or so here. It's also 60 degrees outside, and it's June for God's sake. I want it to be warm and dry for a week so I can take the top off my Jeep.
