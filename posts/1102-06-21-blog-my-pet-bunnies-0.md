Well, one of my bunnies kicked the bucket. I expected it, of course. Winnie had beat the poor guy up pretty bad. Anyway, I disposed of the dead bunny and took some photos of the living ones.

I'm trying my best to not take one inside and try to raise it as my own. They're so adorable. But I know they'll be happier and healthier outside. 

I get to eat Hoops and see Polk tomorrow. I couldn't be more excited.
