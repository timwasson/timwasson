I'm leaving for the day. My aunt called me at work and cancelled our lesson for tonight, thankfully. I wasn't in the mood to do it anyway. Instead, I'll go home and draw. I should be productive, but I don't feel like it, so I'm just going to whip out my big old paper and the messiest art supplies I own, and provide myself a little therapy. I know I'll feel better tomorrow.
