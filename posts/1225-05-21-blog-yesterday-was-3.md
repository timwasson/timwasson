Yesterday was the first company outting I've attended. It was at Hoops, so I was nice and comfortable and ready to eat some pizza. It wasn't nearly as awkward as I had anticipated, and everyone was just laughing and having a good time. It was good. I definitely think I'm going to like working here. 

Then it was back home where I did more painting, more cabinet mounting, and some ant killing. Then I finished Critters and started Godzilla and then went to bed. Exciting times.

Today Wolfie and Jaimee are going to come see where I work, then we're going to Hooters. I sure do like Hooters.
