I saw Dayv last night when I took Alan dinner. He was dressed fancier than I was.

So I get home and see dozens of massive mushrooms in my back yard. Dozens. And massive. They weren't there in the morning, but they were in the evening. Crazy. I kicked a few over, but it left their stems. I wonder what the best mushroom removal tool is.
