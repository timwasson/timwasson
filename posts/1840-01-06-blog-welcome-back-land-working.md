Well, not yet, but I'm busy applying to all sorts of jobs today. I just called 1 lady whose ad offers a $1000 sign on bonus and $530/week starting pay. I doubt that I'll get either of those if I get the job, but it's worth a shot. 

The problem is that I have no idea what the company does. When I called, it seemed like they were looking for a delivery driver, since she asked me about a reliable car and such. But that seems a bit odd. Their ad said they were looking for all sorts of positions. I guess I'll ask about it during the interview. This is just the first time I've ever applied to, and been interviewed for, a job that I have no idea what it is. Hm.
