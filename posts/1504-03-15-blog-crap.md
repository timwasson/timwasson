I feel like crap. I'm sick. I've been getting progressively sicker all day. My throat hurts, my head hurts, I'm hot one second, cold the next, and my hands are shaking. This sucks. What sucks even more is that I have a somewhat busy night and can't just rest, as I'd like to do. 

Today is also pay day, and the day that my car payment and insurance payments are taken out of my account. That would be great, except that I paid off my credit card and don't have enough money in there to cover both withdrawals. Luckily today is payday. Except I haven't gotten paid yet. I better get my check, or one of those payments will bounce, and that will suck. 

I'm now done complaining. Thank you for your time.
