It's that time of year again. It's time to improve as a human being, turn your life around, make this year better than last, etc. And like always, I have my own list.

1. **Lose weight.** My weight has been an issue for me for as long as I can remember, going up and down and up and down again. This year I resolve to get it down again and hopefully try to stop it from going back up.

2. **Open my mail the second I get it.** I've gotten into a bad habit of throwing it all into an unorganized pile until I have dozens of articles of mail to go through. And let's face it, I need an easy resolution that I'm sure I can accomplish. This one is easy.

3. **3 hours of TV or less per week.** I've been thinking about this one a lot lately. I could be a much more productive person if I turned off the damn TV. Using that extra time, I can do leisurely but productive activities, like reading a book or putting a puzzle together or playing a board games. It's more time for hobbies and producing something, rather than sitting and looking at a magical moving box. Horror movies are excluded from this goal.

I'm going to create another post for freelancing and business development resolutions. That's a whole other cup of tea.
