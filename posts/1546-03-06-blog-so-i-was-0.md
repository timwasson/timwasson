So I was up until like 3am trying to get this mailing list script working, and finally, mission accomplished. You can sign up for a junkmachine.com mailing list now. Worthless, sure, but I've been wanting to be able to make scripts like that for a while, so any practice is good practice.

Not a whole lot else going on. Fabish got me all excited today with plans of going out to eat Chinese food, only to disappoint me later. I guess we're going Friday instead, but I'm hungry for Chinese now.
