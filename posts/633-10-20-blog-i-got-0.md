I got the job. The cartoon job. Making a cartoon. This is like the 2nd time in my career I've been paid to make a cartoon, so I'm pumped about it. And it's not porn. And it will be fun to work on. I'm back to being an animator after a short time off.

I'm not getting paid as much as I would have liked, but it doesn't matter. This is going to be fun and will get me some exposure, and he promises a pay raise once I prove myself as good and reliable. He told me he was in discussions with dozens of animators and illustrators, but he's only giving 3 of them the chance to make a cartoon, and I'm one of them. Maybe I don't suck as much as I thought I did. 

Today I'm really busy. I have some work to do for the guy and the cartoon, I have to start typing up my Nintendo tutorial, I have to go to my parent's and pick up my laundry. So it's a busy day.
