At the request of Emma (who said that people should remove her from their list if her journal made the uncomfortable), I have done just that. So this is friends-only, minus her.

I took her off because of her drama and because of her recent Wolfie bashing in her journal. I debated for a while telling her why I took her off, but decided against it. She'll make up her own reasons in her head despite whatever I tell her the reason is, so it's best to just not bother with it. 

If she asks any of you why, please don't bother with an answer. Please just say I never mentioned why, and please don't let her try to guess. I want to keep my name out of her mouth, hopefully for the rest of our lives. I don't want the drama or argument in my life, and the conflict any of it would cause simply isn't worth it.

I don't like who I am when I'm reading her journal and thinking negative thoughts about her, and I don't like who I am when I make fun of her behind her back and call her nuts. I'd rather just not be associated with her in any way, shape, or form from this point on. I just know she'd only have a negative effect on my life, and I simply don't have time for that. 

Anyway, I don't care if any of you keep her on your lists or talk to her on AIM or whatever, but if you're going to be hanging out with me, please don't invite her. If you invite me someplace where she's going to be, please don't expect me to go (although the invitation will be nice). 

That's about all I have to say about that.
