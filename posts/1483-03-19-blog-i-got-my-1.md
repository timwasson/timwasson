I got my new phone, and it's awesome. The pictures it takes are way better than my old one. Look [here][1] and check out the last pic I sent there. Neat.

Uh, what else? The house is taking shape, and I'm spending a lot of time in the yard lately. This morning I cut down all the bushes out front because they were hideous. Tomorrow I'll load all the crap into the truck, remove some rail road ties, and pull out the stumps of the bushes if possible. If not possible, then... well... I haven't figured that part out yet. 

I'm having a really hard time thinking about anything other than this possible new job and how I'll pay off my credit card debt and spend the rest of the money on other necessary home improvement type stuff. 

The music playing in the mall just got very loud. I hate working in the mall.
