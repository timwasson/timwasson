Fun day yesterday. I finally got to eat at a Chinese Buffet, which I had been craving for weeks. After work I went to Alan's for Simpsons and beer, a tradition which neither of us has taken part in since leaving the old apartment. Brynn and Angie came by later and we hit Jimmy's. I kept saying that I had to be home by midnight because I have a business meeting this morning at 9, only to come home at about 1 and find out that I have to be at the house appraisal at 8 this morning. So, I'm about to leave to that on very little sleep. I'm tired. I want to go back to bed. Instead I have a busy day meeting many strangers.
