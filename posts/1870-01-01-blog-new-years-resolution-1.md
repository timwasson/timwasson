&nbsp;Well, it's been well over a year since my last blog entry, and while I'm sure no one will read other blog entries, or this one, I'm still gonna type it up.

This year has been a big one, and 2012 promises to be even bigger and better. 2011 brought another happy year of marriage, a move into a newer, nicer home, changes in my business and workplace and more. 2012 will bring my first baby. That's about as big as 2012 will need to be, to be honest, but I do have some resolutions that will help me accomplish my goals this year.&nbsp;

- Be a great father. I'll accomplish this through massive amounts of patience and trusting of other people's advice who know more than I do. I've already started collecting advice from fathers and keeping a mental list of their tips and tricks.

- Be a great husband. Hill and I work hard on our relationship and we'll continue to do that.&nbsp;

- Improve my business. I have a laundry list of ways I want to do that, like branching out to other cities in my area, getting into mobile app and mobile web business, starting passive income streams, finding a reputable accountant and more. I've been really successful in my business, and been pretty passive about it in the last year. Time to get back on the horse and take it seriously.&nbsp;

- Blog and write more. I have a horrible memory, but if I blog consistently about what I'm doing, at least I can go back and read about what I was doing at certain dates.&nbsp;
