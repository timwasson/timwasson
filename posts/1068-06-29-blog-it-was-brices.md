It was Brice's last night in town last night. Me, him, and Fabish ate some Chinese food, Brice went home to pack, Fabish and I went back and drank, Fabish left, Brice came over, Brice left, Alan got home, Jamie called Alan, then I went to sleep. No bats attacked me last night. Anytime no bats attack me, I will consider it a good night from now on. It's a new standard.
