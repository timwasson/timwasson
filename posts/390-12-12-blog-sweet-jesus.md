Lab

Come on in, grab a drink, and put your paws up - your frank,  
easygoing personality and lovable good nature make you the  
perfect party-going Lab. Always delighted to meet new  
people, you're truly interested in finding out what makes them  
tick. Your ready smile and genuine curiosity help you break the  
ice with all kinds of folks, and you excel at making them relax  
and feel comfortable. Heck, you don't even have to try - it  
comes naturally. You're in top form at backyard barbecues,  
casual get-togethers, and cookouts on the beach. And you  
don't go to parties to network or hook up (at least, not on  
purpose...) - you're just there to have a good time. Which you  
usually do. 

Damn. That personality test thing was a crock, but this couldn't be more accurate.
