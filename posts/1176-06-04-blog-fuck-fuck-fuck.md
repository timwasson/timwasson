Yeah, so today is my last homeless day. The word is that I move into my new place tonight at 5. Sign my lease, move on in, and spend the night tonight. I'm pretty excited, but pissed off because I was supposed to move in this morning when the weather was nice and the skies were clear. Instead I was put off for a few more hours until 5, when it will surely be raining like a mother, making me unable to move anything that I don't want to be soaked.

Or maybe I'm being pessimistic, and the rain will have cleared up by 5. We'll see.
