Another thing I hate: Road construction. Something I hate more: Road construction where all they do is put a bunch of blocks and signs and arrows up but don't actually do anything.

I take Knoxville to get downtown every morning, and this morning it was 1 lane from Nebraska nearly to 74. No one was even working or there from what I could tell. Can't they just wait until rush hour is over to put their barrels and signs up? I hate you, road construction. 

I also hate the people who don't wait for their turn in line, but instead speed to the front and cut people off.

end rant.
