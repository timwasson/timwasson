Well, life is barreling on and getting better every day.&nbsp;

Unfortunately a new job I landed will prevent me from talking too much about my freelancing career. I am a new blogger over at [Freelance Folder][1], which I am very excited about. That means I am currently paid for my input regarding Apple products and freelancing, which if you think about it, is pretty insane. I am close to having to consider myself close to a freelance writer in addition to designer.&nbsp;

So, the blog that no one reads (the one you're reading right now) is having to cut out all work-related type posts. I guess I could still post about personal stuff, like saying that work is so crazy busy right now that I can't keep up, but the timing couldn't be better. I'm trying to stay sane amongst the chaos of work and, for the most part, I am. I do get stressed out, but how stressful of a life can I be leading when I started every day last week with a cup of hot chocolate and a round of Mario Kart?&nbsp;

London plans are still moving along at a pretty decent clip. Due to the mutt and the quarantine, we're looking at late April or early May before we can make the trip. While it's still not 100% certain, it's getting more certain every day. The wifey and I dream of spending our first anniversary in a foreign country, maybe sipping wine in France or Italy and celebrating our great life together.&nbsp;

I do wish I had a little more free time. The bike refinishing project is stuck now with no extra time for me to get around to it and I always have several other projects I want to tackle. I'll get to everything, ya know, eventually.
