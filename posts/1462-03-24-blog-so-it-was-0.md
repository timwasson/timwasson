So, it was a long ass day of yard work. After breaking a shovel, an axe, and bending a pick axe on the bushes, I decided there had to be an easier way to remove the stumps. I haven't figured out what that way is, but I will. 

I decided to take time off from bush removal and focus on railroad tie removal. In the process, I smashed my foot up really good. I'm pretty sure I broke, or at least cracked it. That may sound like a joke, but it isn't. My foot is black and blue and swelled up and hurts like a motherfucker. I can't bend my big toe. I'm pretty sure it's messed up. I also got, and popped, a blister which also hurts. 

Anyway, so that's my day. Jaimee and I also saw Eternal Sunshine today, which was excellent. Very, very good. The writing was genius, the acting was splendid, and it was just one of those movies that made you think. Fantastic flick. I recommend it to everyone reading this.
