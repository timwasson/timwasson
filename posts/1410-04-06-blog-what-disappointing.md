What a disappointing night last night.

I didn't go out like I was supposed to. No one called me. Sad me. Instead I watched TV. Specifically, I watched 2 very disappointing sequels. Blade 2, which was lame, and Cube 2: Hypercube which was ultra-lame. How was Cube 2 even related to Cube 1? Maybe I'm just too dumb to understand it.
