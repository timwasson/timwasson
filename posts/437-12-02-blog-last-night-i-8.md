Last night I downloaded K-Pax, Iron Monkey, and Tomb Raider. Tonight I will watch them, but right now I have work to do.

The weekend was really uneventful. On Friday my sister called and brought over her shiny new car for me to see. Then we went out to my parent's house for some dinner. After dinner, me, Sarah, and Robert went out to see Behind Enemy Lines, which was excellent. 

Last night I just sort of sat around, downloaded some movies, played on my computer, and did a little bit of work. Iona gave me a ton of stuff to do last week, which sucks because I really just want some time off right now. I have this web-project I'm doing for myself which is going to be fairly time consuming. Ah well, such is life... I'll get everything taken care of.

Next week I'm also going to have to spend some time at my sister's house painting her nursery in preparation for that kid of hers that's on the way. I'm really looking forward to being an uncle. I think I'm going to be a good one.
