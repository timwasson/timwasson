Things I wanted to accomplish this weekend:

1. Clean the apartment, especially my room.  
2. Do my laundry.  
3. Finish setting up my computer.  
4. Run cable to the bedrooms.  
5. Clean out the Jeep.  
6. Go grocery shopping.

Things I actually got accomplished this weekend:

None of the above.

But, nonetheless, this was a good weekend for the most part.

I left work at noon on Friday. I wanted to pick up some things at the mall, then I was heading off to Naperville to visit Jaimee. The drive was horrible on account of the weather. They closed off the highway I use to get into town, so I had to take a weird backwards way into town. I don't know my way around the 'burbs well enough to do that with any kind of confidence, but I made it, and that's what matters in the long run, I guess.

Like Jaimee, I won't go into detail. Although, I'm pretty sure her assumption about no one caring is offensive. I'll have to think about it for a while, but I think I'll be offended. Yeah, I'm offended.

Despite her whining, I had to leave earlyish on Saturday. My dad is selling his prize possession, a 1965 GTO. It's half apart right now, and being repainted. He wanted to put everything back together and get it ready to show. Unfortunately, the garage we'd be working at was closed and we couldn't find the owner. So, as it turns out, my trip to Naperville was cut short for no good reason at all. 

I was really, really tired all day on Saturday. Angie called, and we decided we'd go to "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?" that night. It was around 5, and she was taking a nap until 7, when she'd call me with the plans for the night. I decided I'd take a nap too, just to be awake for Coen's latest movie. 

Well, I went to sleep, and woke up a little before 10. Fearing I'd missed Angie's call, I ran to the phone and checked the caller ID, only to see that she hadn't called. I was a bit relieved, since now the fact that we didn't go out was her fault. 

I went back to bed within the hour and slept until 11 the next day. I haven't done the math to figure out how many hours of sleep that is, and frankly I don't care to know.

On Sunday I went over to finally finish fixing Robyn's stereo. I couldn't do it. I felt like such a failure, but such is life, I guess. I think there's something wrong with the radio itself, but that's just my theory. 

Me, Mullens, Brice, and Angie all ate dinner at Pizza Hut, and then me and Angie finally saw "Oh Brother", which was great. I highly recommend it.
