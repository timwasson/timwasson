For a couple days now, my nephew Peter has been getting progressively sicker. Finally it was bothersome enough that my sister took him to his doctor, who promptly admitted him into the hospital in the intensive care unit with a bad case of pneumonia. He's in the hospital now and will be for a few days.

I know not everyone reading this is the praying type, but if you are, a little prayer that he gets home for Christmas would be appreciated. If you're not the praying type, maybe just think good thoughts about healthy children and direct a little of that positive energy towards my nephew. 

It's not life-threatening or anything, but I think everyone would like to see his first Christmas spent at home and not the hospital.
