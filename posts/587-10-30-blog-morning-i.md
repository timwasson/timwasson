This morning I woke up bright and early (for me) to go jogging. I've decided that when I don't work at the gallery, I want to jog 2 miles, twice a day. I've done that for 3 or 4 days now. This morning I was getting ready when I realized my calves hurt like a motherfucker. At first it felt like a cramp, but it wasn't going away. After standing there in agony for a while, the pain subsided a bit. Now I can't even tell I messed something up except when I walk around. I just walk carefully. I may take tonight off from the jogging thing to heal. 

Plus, it's time for me to get an eliptical machine anyway. Last night every time I exhaled, my glasses fogged up. Even this morning I could see my breath when I was out walking Winnie. I think that means it's time to stay inside. I've also started doing sit ups and push ups again in addition to my jogging. But all the hard work is paying off. I stepped on the scale this morning. 211. Which means if I starved myself today, I could hit the big 210 landmark by tomorrow and eat me a #4 value meal from McDonald's. And it also means I've lost 40 pounds, which is halfway to my goal. Wait... only halfway? Shit.

In any case, I don't think I'm going to eat a #4 value meal just yet. I'm on a roll, and don't want to ruin it. Maybe McDonald's can wait until 200. 

I've also decided that I hate my beard, but I will not cut it off until I hit 200, as a bit of extra motivation for me. I've also decided that I won't even trim my beard between 210 and 200, as even more motivation. 

This has been an update on the dieting life of me.

Tonight Jack is coming over dressed as Spider-Man. I have to get out of the house for a bit to go to the store and get some candy for the trick or treaters. And I have to clean a bit. And I have to work on my cartoon. So it's busy, but that's okay.
