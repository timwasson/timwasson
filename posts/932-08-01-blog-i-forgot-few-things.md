In my overly detailed account, I forgot to add a few things. 

First of all, yesterday Mullens kept trying to call me. He always calls me from work, and we always get interrupted about 25 seconds into each phone call so he can help a customer. He'll call me back 20 minutes later, and do the same thing. Anyway, eventually he stopped calling and just came on by. I have to admit that it was good to see him again. I've come to the conclusion that Mullens is still a good guy at heart, when it boils down to it. He's done things I don't like and acted in a less than mature and responsible way, but I think he's got a good heart. Angie, on the other hand, I believe to have a bad heart. I don't think she's a good person, but I think she's gotten really good at acting like one. But I'm getting away from the point.

The strangest part of the visit was right when I opened the door and he mentioned how I dyed my hair. It really bad been a long, long time since we'd seen each other or talked. He asked me what I was up to, and I couldn't think of a thing to say. I mentioned meeting Bruce Campbell and attending my grandma's funeral earlier that day, but it wasn't until much, much later that I remembered to mention quitting my job. 

This conversation struck me as very odd. I got pretty excited as I was talking about freelancing, telling Mullens all about the tax write offs, making my own hours, etc. etc. etc. He said something like "Wow, I can't believe you're starting your own business." Below is the conversation that followed.

"Well, I'm not really starting my own business. I'm just going freelance."  
"So who will you be working for?"  
"A lot of different companies. I'm not really going to be employed by anyone, just working for them."  
"So you go to different companies and sell your services to people?"  
"Yeah."  
"And how is that different from starting your own business?"

I couldn't think of a good way to answer that question. I had never considered it starting my own business or going into business for myself or any of that.... I just considered it freelancing. A step in the big process of wherever it is I'm going, finding whatever it is I'm looking for. But I guess it is a business. As I described it more, it only sounded more like a business to me and him. I mentioned keeping in touch with some people if I took a bid on a project I was incapable of completing myself, and paying them to do some things for me. He called it 'outsourcing'. I guess it is, technically, but I had never even thought to apply a term to it.

This weekend will be spent preparing myself for this big jump. Me and my dad are going to go place an order for a big, bad computer. We also have to cancel our current cell phone plan and get a new one that I will use for my 'business'. Then it's on to talk to an accountant to discuss everything I have to do and be prepared for. This includes saving receipts, something I've always sucked at. But it will be nice, since when you're a freelancer, everything is tax deductable. My computer, internet access, car payments, car insurance, mileage, rent, software, web page hosting, everything. My dad said I'll be doing VERY well for myself if I claim $10,000 a year while working freelance because of all the deductables. Weird.

In one month, I will no longer be employed by anyone.
