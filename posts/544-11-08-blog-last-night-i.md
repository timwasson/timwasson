Last night I had a really bizarre dream. I don't remember much of it, except being in the back seat of my friend's car with this girl I knew from grade school who is this huge slut these days. We were just sitting back there talking, and all the sudden she jams her tongue down my throat. My other friends in the car were all surprised and disturbed, but it didn't slow us down any. We just kept going at it, until finally I started laughing. She got really pissed. Here's what the dream dictionary said about kissing....

"A dream of kissing is an omen of good and shows love, peace and contentment if the kiss is of a gentle and loving manner from someone who is loved, but if the kiss is in any wise unwelcome, or from an illicit source, then you will suffer ill to your reputation or many small vexations to the spirit."

Well... hopefully it's a good omen, no? Probably not though. 

I think I've found my new obsession. Of course she has a boyfriend, which is good because that's what I need from someone who I will be obsessed with. I know her from a store she works at, but met her at a party last Friday, then at a bar last night. Weird, eh?

She was getting all up on some ugly dude. I think that was her boyfriend. That's cool though, since this is the kind of behavior I like from her. If my obsession actually wanted something to do with me, I would know not what to do. 

So, in case you hadn't figured it out by now, I went to a bar last night. I stayed out way too late. My dad also bought a new car that I was supposed to drive home. Well, it overheated and he thinks I may have killed the engine. I don't think I did though. The previous owner overheated it several times, so putting this on my head will do no one good. I'm having a pretty hard time feeling bad about it.
