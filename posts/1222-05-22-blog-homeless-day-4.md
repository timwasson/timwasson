These days have gone relatively quickly for the most part. Today Jaimee and I went out to a lazy man's picnic with Winnie, then out for ice cream. I left around 4, and have been doing basically nothing since I got back to my parent's house. It sucks, since they've gotten a satellite dish since I moved out and only have it on one TV. That leaves me very bored most of the time. 

I've been in a creative slump lately. Tonight I think I'm going to go through my old sketch books and half-drawn comics I did in high school and younger and see if that sparks some of that good old creativity. 

Tomorrow I have to go in to the post office and fill out a change of address form, but other than that I have no big plans. I may start the resume renovation/sending out process. I hate that.
