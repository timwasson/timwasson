Wednesday night = Hoops night, so Jaimee and I headed down and met Mullens and Anna's little brother Will. Jaimee got a few free slices since they ruined (kinda) her first ones. 

I came home, downloaded a few more albums, and worked a bit on Optimus. He's really coming along, if I do say so myself. Just one more coat of Bondo and a bit of touching up and he'll be ready to start fitting the parts inside. Then the paint job. Then he's done and I go back on TV.
