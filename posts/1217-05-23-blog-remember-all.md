Remember all that bitching about redoing the floors? Forget I said any of it. The 4th 14 hour day in a row working on the damn thing, and we put on the 1st layer of poly. Holy crap, that is a nice looking floor. It was worth every second, even though I'll be picking sawdust out of my hair and nose for weeks. Nice, nice, nice.
