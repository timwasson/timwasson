So yesterday my dog was sick. She took 2 dumps in the morning, and I felt bad locking her in the bathroom, but I had a mural to paint. I came back a few hours later, opened the door to my apartment, and it smelled so bad. Worse than usual even. I was afraid to open the door to Winnie's room, but I had to do what I had to do. 

The smell almost gagged me. Winnie came running out and sat by the door, waiting to be let out again. I ran her outside and she squated and shat liquid poo about, honestly, a foot and a half. It was insanity. I let her into the field and took her off her leash. She ran around, squating and pooing every few feet. This went on for about 20 minutes. I took her inside and put her on my deck, knowing that it was about to rain, so that I wouldn't have to clean up anything else if she had another accident. Then it was time to face the shit.

I have a terrible gag reflex. Anything sets it off. The smell almost made me puke. Cleaning up a mixture of puke and shit would be too much for me to bear. I held my breath and cleaned for about 30 seconds at a time before running back out for a few puffs of air. Shit was everywhere. On the floor, walls, bathtub, sink, toilet. The poo literally shot out of her butt. 

I sprayed the whole floor with Orange Clean, then spilled bleach all over it, then covered it in OxyClean. That pretty much covered the smell, and it made this cool foam all over the floor. I strapped some paper towels to my shoes and finished the job by wandering around the floor. What a terrible experience.

So that was my day yesterday. Then I watched BOTS. Next week is the last episode, and I'm really sad and disappointed about it. I love that show.
