So, the nervousness about the whole TV appearance is setting in. I haven't finished my NES PC, and time is getting tight. 

My house is still not unpacked. There's boxes and clutter everywhere. 

There was a job in the classifieds yesterday for an illustrator. I'm going to go see what that's all about. 

There's a package waiting for me at the post office. I haven't the foggiest idea who it's from.

Tomorrow is dinner at Kouri's.
