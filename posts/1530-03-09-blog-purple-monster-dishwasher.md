Well, my little plan to restore my love of illustration has definitely helped. I bought a Cintiq and am still adjusting to it, but in the meantime I'm drawing for an hour or 2 per night and posting the results to whoever will let me, including the blog [Sugar Frosted Goodness][1] and my new favorite forum, [The Drawing Board][2]. I have a lot of work to do to improve my skills again and ultimately fulfill my goal of making money with my illustration, somehow, by the end of the year.
