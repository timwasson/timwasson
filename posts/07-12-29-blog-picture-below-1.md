The picture below is a picture I took while sitting in the parking lot of my office building, waiting for my boss so I could follow her to a bar and drink beers. It serves a double purpose to show how I can drive a stick, which of course means I'm a real man. Manual transmission = real manly man. Simple gradeschool math, really.

So dinner and drinks with the work friends was fun, as per usual. I scooted out early since there's been some bad news floating around one of my friends I don't want to get into. I hope things turn out okay for everyone involved. Oh... how ambiguous and mysterious.
