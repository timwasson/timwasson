So, the Jeepy Jeep is in the shoppy shop, which means I get to pimp around in my brother-in-law's '83 Ford Ranger rust bucket while my car gets a new clutch installed. It's pretty sweet ride. 

Anyway, yeah, my clutch is going on my Jeep, which is exactly the kind of expense I need now, a few weeks before my massive credit card debt gets paid off. Oh well... it's just postponing being debt-free I guess, but its a little frustrating. 

The good news is that in my Building Steam class last night, I did 4.1 miles in 38 minutes. I still finished 2nd place in my group, but whatever... that's a pretty decentish time. 35 minutes shouldn't be too big an issue.
