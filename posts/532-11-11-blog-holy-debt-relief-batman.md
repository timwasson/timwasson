I'd heard a rumor that if I called in and tried to cancel my GM card that they would give me all sorts of deals to make me keep it. I only half-believed the rumors until I gave it a shot today. I told them I wanted to cancel and within 5 minutes I'd lowered my interest rate by 6% and my transfer rate by 8%. I increased my credit line an extra $1000. So, the plan is to transfer my debt from my other card onto my GM card. Then I'll have just 1 monthly bill at low, low interest. I'm about $2600 in credit card debt, so hopefully these changes will make it easier for me. Instead of $30-40/month in financing fess, I'll be paying $10-15. Debt free life, here I come!
