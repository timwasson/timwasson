Well, I'm off to a quick weekend in California. Everyone, try not to miss me too horribly badly while I'm gone, although missing me a little is appropriate. I'll be back on Monday, at when I'll crash early to recover from my weekend. Tuesday will probably be spent in recovery as well. Wednesday is 3 pitcher night with Polk. Friday is a birthday party for me. Saturday is another kind of party or something. Monday is VEGAS, BABY. 

These are busy times, but they'll be fun.
