I woke up early this morning for a series of 2 meeting which should have taken the greater half of a day. Unfortunately, they did not. They took the greater half of an hour, leaving me to sit around for the rest of the day and be productive at the same things I was productive with yesterday, including but not limited to setting up several online portfolios, bidding on jobs, and replying the the dozens of emails that collected while I was sleeping. 

Tomorrow is Spike and Mike's Twisted Animation Festival. I can't wait.
