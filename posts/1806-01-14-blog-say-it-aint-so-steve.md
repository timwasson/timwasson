We've seen Steve Jobs lose weight and look more and more weak during the vaious MacWorlds and Developer Conferences over the past couple years. When he bowed out of the 2009 MacWorld, most of us insane Apple guys got worried, but kept pretty silent when it came to worrying about his health. Well, today [our fears were confirmed][1].

My selfish side wants Steve to get well so I can expect new and better Mac products. My human side wants him to get well because he's a human being and I wouldn't wish health problems upon anyone.

I hope Steve returns to Apple, but I am not holding my breath for it.

Get well soon, Steve.
