I got soaked running out of work yesterday, but the import part is that I survived. Jaimee and I went to Steak 'n Shake where we were waited on by the most awesome waiter in the whole wide world. He gave Jaimee coupons for her meal and just seemed so happy to be serving us. 

I came home and spent a few more hours sanding away on Optimus. Sanding, sanding, and more sanding. And even more sanding to do tonight. I'm totally excited for it.

I tried to get a hold of John so Mullens and I could take him out tonight, but his phone has been cut off. I don't know what we'll do now.
