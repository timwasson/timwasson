Yesterday I woke up bright and early to take care of stuff I hadn't quite taken care of. This included cutting off my energy, cable, internet, and phone at my old apartment. I finished all that up around noon and headed up to DeKalb to see Jaimee. I brought along my retarded dog.

Now Jaimee is at work and I'm alone in her apartment. I made the trek to find Goldfinger's new album, which is excellent. I've drawn some drawrings and I'm getting ready to watch some TV. It's a fun time. I don't really have any big plans for the remaining 10 homeless days ahead of me. I just really want to get moved into my new place.
