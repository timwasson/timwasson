So, half of day 1 of this diet is now complete. I've learned a few valuable lessons since starting this thing. 

1. Oatmeal tastes like nothing if you don't put brown sugar in it.  
2. Squash tastes like nothing.  
3. Rice tastes like nothing. 

Tonight I eat zucchini and asparagus, which I hope also taste like nothing, since I have to choke it down and nothing is better than gross.

I've kind of been fighting off some sort of cold or something lately. Hopefully these vitamins and vegetables I'm eating will help with that whole thing.

I didn't paint at Childer's last night because of this "illness" or whatever it is. Tonight and tomorrow I'll be there, and Wednesday I'll be finishing a mural in Morton. Fun times, I tell ya.
