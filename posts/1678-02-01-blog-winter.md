It feels good to actually have a "real" winter here again. Snow every few days, bitter cold, ice-scraping every time I want to drive somewhere. Yep, this is a good, midwestern winter after a couple of winters that were way to mild for my tastes.

Although I could do without another Monday night. I left my house at about 6:05 with no snow on the ground and only very light snowfall. By 6:15 I was stopped on a busy street which was already down to 1 lane because of all the snow piled in the other lane. I saw 3 cars in the ditch or side of the road, turned around. My Jetta is absolutely awful in the snow and had I known what I was getting myself into, I would have taken the Jeep.

Anyway, I eventually made it to my destination: the bowling alley. If I had it to do over, I wouldn't have.

What I've noticed: This blog is either incredibly boring or incredibly whiny. I hope everyone is enjoying it. But there's good news on the horizon whenever I feel like announcing it to the world. Until then, just assume you're in the relatively small group of people who already know. Oooohh.... cryptic.
