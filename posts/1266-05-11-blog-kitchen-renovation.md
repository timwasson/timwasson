The kitchen renovation is going well and should be complete in 2 more weekends. Next weekend is either the front porch or bathroom. Or both, depending on our ambition. 

Things are good. I'm nearly a week and a half into my new job and still loving it. I'm waking up earlier and have started exercising. Again. With me being on the ground level and the food/snack/beverage area being on the 3rd floor, I have decided to take the stairs each and every time I go up. It makes my legs hurt, but in that good way. And one of these days I'm actually going to wake up early enough to jog before work. 

What else, what else... I'm pretty excited about The Inferno finale and "event" next week, but I'm sad it's over.
