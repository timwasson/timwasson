Last night sure was eventful. After my 11 hour shift at Northwoods I headed down to Hoops to meet Jaimee and Mullens for some pizza and a drink or 2. As I'm sure most of you have read, Jaimee's purse was stolen. We didn't get a lot of sleep last night since a theif had our house keys and our address. Every little noise I'd feel the need to come investigate what was going on downstairs, and Winnie had a huge barking outbreak at one point which scared the shit outta me. 

I was quite proud of myself for seeing the guy in the alley and actually running after him. I wish I had yelled something at him, but was kind of afraid about what he would do. After all, it was just me and him in a dark alley. Instead I just got a good look at his car.

As Jaimee mentioned, I hope the guy is shitting himself. I hope he saw us standing on the corner calling the cops and waiting. I hope he realized that this was a hard fucking way to make $4 and maybe his time would be better served working at Taco Bell. I hope he saw me chase after him. I hope he thinks I got his license plate numbers and I hope he goes to the DMV today to get new plates. I hope he knows he was caught on video and that he can never go back to Hoops again because Kelly remembers everyone. 

More than anything, though, I hope he comes into my store today to try and activate my phone. I have it all planned out in my head and it amuses me to no end, although I realize it's really unlikely that it'll happen. 

Anyway, after my 11 hour shift at Northwoods, this was about the last thing I wanted to deal with. I got a lot more sleep than Jaimee, but only about 3 or 4 hours, tops. I'm tired and sure won't do a good job today. I'm going to try and get someone to cover the last part of my shift for me. We'll see how that goes.
