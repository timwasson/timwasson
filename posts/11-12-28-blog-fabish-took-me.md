Fabish took me out to dinner tonight. I assumed an innocent dinner until he told me he had an announcement. I guessed it pretty quickly, but let him break the news. He's going to be a daddy. [I remember when he got married][1], and how bizarre it was to look at my best friend as a husband (although not mine). Now I'll be looking at him as a daddy (although not mine).

Congrats to the Fabish family. The kid better call me Uncle Tim or I'll be pissed.
