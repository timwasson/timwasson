Have I mentioned I'm on a bowling league? Because I am, and we start tonight, and I'm totally pumped for it. I spent the weekend in silent anticipation for today and my bowling league debut. 

Friday my long-lost best friend Fabish called with a night off from the wife and kid. We hit Sully's happy hour, just like old times. The beer was a little more expensive and free wings had been replaced with free pizza and cheap wings, but it was still a great and cheap dinner. Afterwards we headed back to his house for beer bought from Aldi's and some Dateline NBC. I was in bed pretty early. 

Saturday I cleaned. And cleaned. And cleaned some more. I finished up just as Angie picked me up to head to Texas Road House to eat for free with her parents. After dinner, we hit Kelleher's for a couple of beers with Brian and his new wife. 

The ride home was one of the scariest moments of my life. It was Saturday night at prime go-out time and there was a torrential downpour going on. Not normally a big deal, except that drunk bar-goers were dashing into the streets against the lights to get out of the rain, which made me slam on my brakes on several occassions to stop from killing someone. Yeah, it happened multiple times as I made my way out of downtown. I turned into one of those drivers I hate who was going half the speedlimit, washers on high, hunched over the steering wheel and driving overly paranoid like. I managed to get out of town without killing anyone. At least I think I did. 

Anyway, after that adventure we just watched some Lost. It was pretty much the perfect night. I'd say perfect day, except that I spent so much of it cleaning. 

Sunday I tried, and failed, at fixing Angie's Dad's computer, then went out to eat with my parents and spent the rest of the day lounging around and working on my GB-PVR box.
