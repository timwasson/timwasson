I'd forgotten how awesome my bike is, and how much fun it is to ride. I took a long ride this weekend, all the way to work to see how long it would take me. I do plan on making the trip on my bike once a week, even with the additional mileage the move added. 

Anyway, I've been really consistent with my exercise and food lately, which feels great. My rekindled love affair with my bike should only help that.

In other news, I'm in the market for an old-school, Pee-Wee Herman style bike. If anyone knows of anything rad like that, hook me up, yo.
