I guess I haven't updated in a while.

So on Friday was my night with my boyz at Donnelly's or however you spell it. We missed Kristi, but managed to have good conversation and lots of laughs, as per usual. Afterwards I went to Angie's with the intention of going out later, but quickly got tired and called it a night early. I'm not as young as I used to be, I guess. 

Saturday I pretty much did nothing, which was awesome. That night Angie and I braved not only the cold, but also a long-ass car ride out to some town I've never heard of for a barbeque with her work friends. It was okay, but as I mentioned, very cold. All the guys were amazed and fascinated by my Transformers ring tone. I don't blame them. It's a sweet ring tone. 

That night we went out, even though I didn't really want to. I went out because of a promise that Steph, one of my good friends I haven't seen in a long time, would call. She didn't. Well, not until it was far too late. But I managed to have an okay time despite not really wanting to be out. We went to Gorman's and The Friendly Valley, which is such an awesome, crappy little bar. Good times.

Sunday was a barbeque with my family. The highlight was when Jack asked who broke his chair. My mom explained that I broke it. Jack immediately got upset and started yelling at me, asking why I broke his chair. It didn't seem to phase him that I broke it 10 years ago or so, and if I was going to be punished for it, I certainly would have by then. He ended up sending me to time-out, which was pretty much the cutest thing he's ever done. Well, except for when he announced to the waiter at Avanti's that he was wearing big-boy underwear.

This week has been pretty uneventful, with the exception of watching my new favorite shows. Battle of the Sexes 2 and The Biggest Loser. With the lack of Last Comic Standing, I needed another reality show to fill in the gap. 

Last night was more fun than I thought I could have on a weeknight. Angie, Brynn and I went to Perkins since they were achin' for breakfast food for some reason. The whole time, we were just laughing and joking and having a good time. It got really interesting when I bet them that they couldn't eat their whole meal, and if they did, I'd pay for it. It was hilarious watching them be so miserable and full, yet jamming hash browns down their throats with a look of defeat on their face. They ended up falling a bit short of their goal, but I paid anyway since I'm such a nice guy. The other awesome thing that happened was when I was about 2/3rds done with my hamburger and realized that I didn't order a hamburger, but a chicken sandwich. I ended up getting a free piece of pie out of the deal. I get free pie about half the time I go there. I like free pie. I also really enjoyed the hamburger.
