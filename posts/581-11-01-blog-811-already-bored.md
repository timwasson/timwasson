I check a few forums here from work since I don't have anything else to do. I checked them already, so I've done what I needed to do.

The rest of my day will be spent updating my resume for a new job. Is it bad to do this while working at another company? Oh well. 

Last night I drank beer and smoked cigars with some good friends of mine. It was a good time, but no one wanted to go to the sanitarium. So, me and another guy went, but got lost in this backwoods racist hicktown, then finally pulled over to a gas station and had to ask how to get to Peoria. It was pretty embarrassing, being like 10 miles away and living in Peoria, not knowing how to get there. Our excuse is that we try to avoid going to that town, and therefore don't know our way around. The real excuse is that we were probably too drunk to navigate through the town well.

Well that's about it for me. For now.
