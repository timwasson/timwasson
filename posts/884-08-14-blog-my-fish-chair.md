My fish chair for chair-ity is almost complete. It's not exactly how I hoped it would be, but it turned out pretty nice. I had this horrible nightmare last night, though. I dreamed that I took the chair to the auction and wandered around looking at everyone else's chair. Mine was the worst of the bunch, and when it came time for them to move mine onto the stage for the auction, the whole thing collapsed. It was a terrible dream.

Anyway, all I need to do at this point is paint it and find a way to attach some cushions to it. Yay for cushions.

Still no word on the Dynamic Graphics job, although I tried to call today and just got her voice mail. I'll call again tomorrow. My interview at Pudik is a week from today.
