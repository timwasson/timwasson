Well, I'm about ready to leave for the weekend. On top of our 22,000 inches of snow, we now have a foot and a half of freezing rain. Driving home will be like ice skating.

If I never type again, assume that I died on my way home tonight.

Anyway, I'm having another, smaller, party tomorrow, and no other plans this weekend. It won't be eventful by any means, but it will be nice. 

Have a good weekend everyone.
