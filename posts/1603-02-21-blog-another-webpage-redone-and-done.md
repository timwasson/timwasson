So, i got my first CGI script working. It was a script that I downloaded for free and should have taken about 15 minutes to get it to work, but instead it took about 3 hours because I didn't know what I was doing. It's a petition to bring back Mr. Pibb and get rid of that horrible Pibb Xtra replacement. You should go sign it here:

And after that, go to:

and read the stupid crap I've been working on today.

In an unrelated story, Alan brought home a bunch of fireworks tonight so we were playing with them. He decided it would be a good idea to launch a bottle rocket into the toilet, and after doing so, the toilet basically exploded. It smelled terrible and our toilet is very, very broken. We're headed to Lowe's tomorrow to get a new one.

Tonight Fabish had diarrhea. I thought that was a hilarious stroke of bad luck for him. So, what does one do when they have diarrhea and no toilet? He crapped into a garbage bag. It was disgusting and hilarious at the same time.
