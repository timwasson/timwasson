Well, I got it. I was one of the first to order it, nearly immediately after it was released. I got it in my grubbly little hands today. I'm still at work at the moment, but when I get home I'll plug this bad boy in and run it through its paces, including in Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Flash, and of course the iLife suites. For now, here's some pictures of the awesomest little computer ever.
