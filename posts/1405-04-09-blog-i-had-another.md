I had another one of those dreams last night. Me and a few others were going to rob a rich old man, but our plan was stopped by security guards, James Woods and Andy Richter. Weird. People were killed and I just wanted out. Then I had to drive an expensive German car somewhere, but I couldn't quite drive it properly since it was a stick shift and my legs were too long. Then I ran into a pig. It was a messed up dream. 

Anyway, I had more I wanted to do to junkmachine.com, but the server appears to be down. That's fun.
