Last night was incredibly exciting and eventful.

I went to eat dinner at my sister's, which I prefer to eating at my parent's. She lives a lot closer and doesn't make crappy food. 

Afterwards I didn't do much... called a few friends, chatted online. I decided I would stay up later than usual last night, since maybe this constant tiredness was caused by too much sleep. I went to bed at about 11:45. I woke up more tired than I have ever been in my life. But, I feel fine now. Wide awake. Strange.

It's the weekend, but I don't feel like doing anything. I just want to paint and watch a movie or something.
