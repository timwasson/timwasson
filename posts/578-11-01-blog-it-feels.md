It feels a little different to update only tim.cx and not LJ at the same time, but I'll get used to it. 

The weekend was good. On Friday Angie and I hit a haunted house for the first time in way too many years. If it hadn't been free, I probably wouldn't have bothered, but it was fun. The highlight was the kids in front of me getting so scared they had to cover their ears and shout "this little light of mine" at the top of their lungs to calm themselves down a bit. 

Saturday we babysat my little nephews, then headed back into town. I headed over to Alan's to hang out for a bit before heading downtown for the first time in a long, long time. Probably since July. I partied like a rock star while watching Mike and Joe, and was out until hours past my bed time. 

I woke up early on Sunday to head out to Hanna City to watch a couple of baptisms. I spent the rest of the day just sitting around and recovering from the night before. 

Last night was Halloween, so I just hung out at Alan's and passed out candy and watched horror movies. I was amazed at the number of kids we got. I think the last 2 years combined I maybe had 10 total. This year we probably had 30 or 40 in different degrees of dress. A few kids too old with no costumes as well. I'll admit that when I was 15 or 16, I was one of those too-old kids who went house to house collecting candy. At least I had a sense of humor about it though, and knew what I was doing was a tad silly. One kid, probably 15 or 16, just knocked on the door and refused to say "trick or treat" or anything fun. I asked what he was supposed to be, and he looked at me like I was retarded and said "uh... MYSELF." I told him that was a shitty costume and he only got 1 piece of candy for it. Punk kids.
