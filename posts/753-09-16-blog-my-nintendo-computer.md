[My Nintendo computer is finished. And it's awesome][1].

The weekend was good. Friday the 13th part 2 scared Jaimee, as I knew it would. Polk was sick so we didn't go to Kouri's. Saturday me and Jaimee ate with my parents and saw My Big Fat Greek Wedding, which wasn't as bad as I expected it to be. And that's as close to a compliment as I'm getting.

Other than that, things have been uneventful. I turn 23 in like 2 weeks. 23 is old.
