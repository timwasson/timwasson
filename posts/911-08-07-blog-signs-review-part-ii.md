So, I just got done watching Signs for the second time, and let me just say that the 2nd time around changed every opinion I had about this movie. This is one of the best movies ever made. Oh, wait, no, it still sucked, and sucked even more hard than the 1st time around. I hate you, M. Night Shamalongadingdong.
