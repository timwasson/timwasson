So the other day it was like 80 or 90 degrees outside, so I went out to my dad's house to wash my car. The next day it rained like a mother, then snowed. That's always fun. 

Nothing is going on. I am still so poor and I really want one of those P'zones from Pizza Hut. I also want Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. I remember when I used to be able to go out and buy stuff. Those were good times.
