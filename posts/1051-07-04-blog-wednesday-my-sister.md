Wednesday my sister had her traditional 4th of July dinner at her house. Jaimee came along and got to meet the fam. Today is the 4th, so of course we have to go watch fireworks by the river. I just got back from seeing Lilo and Stitch with my sister, Robert, mom, Matthew, Samantha, Stephanie, and Tommy. I love free movies.

Other than that, life is boring. I spent today working on a slight facelift for [junkmachine][1] and a new [the thing][2] for <a href="http://joylugod.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">joylugod</a>. I wish I could turn junkmachine stuff into a full time job somehow. I love that stupid site.
