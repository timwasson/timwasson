So, even with the bad news this morning presented me with, it's going to be a good week. I can feel it in my veins. 

1. The break in. With the rips in my top and the water damage on my carpet, I'll be getting a new top, new carpet, new CD player, and new CDs courtesy of the insurance company. For the first time in 7 years, I feel like my car insurance is actually worth paying every month.

2. So far, I have 4 business meetings this week for murals and portraits. And, if that wasn't good enough, THEY all called ME. That's right, THEY called ME. Which is an amazing feeling. Finally, after doing the freelancing thing for almost 2 years, people are calling me and wanting to pay me for drawing and painting. What a feeling.

3. Tomorrow I take care of 2 out of the 3 tasks I need to do to finish with this house buying stuff. And, although our interest rate isn't as good as it could have been, it's better than we originally expected. House payment, insurance, and taxes come out to just over $500/month. Not too shabby, if you ask me.

4. The Screen Savers WILL call this week. I just know it. I just know it.

Update on the robbery:

Some dude just stopped by my apartment. He was taking out his trash when I saw that my car was broken into, so I talked to him about it for a little bit. He just figured out today that his dad's apartment (in my building) as well as his dad's car (parked right next to mine) were broken into. His dad's place gets robbed about once a year, always by the same people who have a grudge against him for some reason. So he gave me a handful of names of people who probably were the ones who broke in. I'm definitely going to call the cops back and tell them what I've learned. It strikes me as ridiculously unfair that people can just break into cars and steal shit and the cops don't even try to find them. Maybe if they get 2 complaints they'll at least investigate a bit and do something about these thieving fuckholes. I'm not expecting this to get me any more money in the insurance thing, or to get my stereo and CDs back, but I want to see the bad guys punished, god damn it.
