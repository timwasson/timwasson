Finally, the end of Friday. This week seems to have gone by a lot quicker than most. It's probably because I've been so busy... not with work, but just in general. 

This weekend is going to be a blast. Anyone in the Peoria area who wants to stop by my place on Saturday for free beer, you're more than welcome. Or even people NOT in the Peoria area who will travel hundred of miles for free beer, you're welcome as well. 

As per usual, I'm leaving early. Have a good weekend everyone, I'll drink a beer for all of you. I expect the same in return.
