This house buying stuff is hard. There's lots of paperwork, and lots of me having to dig through a bunch of folders looking for stuff I never thought I would need. And it's all happening so fast... 

Not much else happening, I guess. I'm really looking forward to this interview on Friday. Hopefully I'll get it. I've done the math, and I figure that between working at the print shop, the gallery, and the freelance gigs I get, I'll be making as much as I did at Iona. The problem is the 60 hour weeks and such, but it's a small price to pay to be able to pay my bills again. 

Speaking of paying my bills, goodbye Circuit City debt! I paid them off this month. I'm down to about $3000 in credit card debt at this point. The guy on TV with the money on his suit tells me the average is $8000, so I'm not too worried or feelin' too bad.
