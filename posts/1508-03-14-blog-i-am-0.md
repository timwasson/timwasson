I am up way too late for my own good. I just compiled a bunch of tax stuff and will be taking it to H&R Block tomorrow. I usually do my own taxes, but this year it's just too much for me to handle. I was employed until September 1st, then self employed for the remainder of the year. I get all sorts of tax breaks for being self employed, but I'll be damned if I know what all of them are.

The good part is that since I was employed until September, I've already paid like $3,500 in taxes this year, and with my deductables, I've made virtually nothing as a freelancer. So hopefully I'll be getting a tax return. Cross your fingers for me, since I am broke and need a break in that department.

Rumor has it that self employed people are supposed to file by March 15th. If the IRS comes calling, I'll plead ignorance, since I had no idea of that until today.
