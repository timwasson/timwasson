While at work yesterday, I got an email from my dad asking if I could go out to their place and eat dinner with them. I went straight there from work and had a good, home cooked dinner and discussed plans for my new career. 

I went home and worked on my webpage. I made lots of progress, although it's still not quite ready to show the real world yet. Maybe tonight, but don't bet on it.

I also updated [hidethecam.com][1] with hysterical pictures of a guy stealing a porno magazine. Everyone should go check it out.
