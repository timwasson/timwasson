Seven days down, seven to go until I move into my new pad.

Last night was the traditional Friday night dinner at Kouri's Pub where I finally got to meet the infamous Jim Kerr. For the second time. It was good times. Afterwards we headed to Polk's place for more drinky drinks. When it was time to head downtown, I said my goodbyes and went home. I shouldn't be spending my money on Big Al's when I'll be having all these moving expenses coming up soon. Plus I was tired since I haven't been sleeping well on my parent's futon.

Today I have no big plans. What a life.
