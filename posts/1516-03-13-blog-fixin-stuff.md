See that?! See there?! I fixed the weather by complaining about it on my blog that no one reads. If I had known it was going to be so easy I would have started complaining weeks ago.

I've been crazy busy with work, then the side projects. But the past few beautiful days I've taken an hour out of my craziness to take the dogs on a long walk. I'd forgotten the simple pleasure of that bit of alone time, listening to my iPod, watching the dogs and their frantic excitement to be more than a few hundred feet away from the house. 

Anyway, I've been just as frantic otherwise as I always am, putting in my standard day at work, then another 2-3 hours per night on side work. I'd be nicer if I didn't need to sleep, and just as I adjusted to this schedule the daylight savings time mess screwed me up again. Bah humbug. 

But soon, I think, this schedule will all be over.

I think.
