I guess I'm an easy guy to please. 

I drink a bottle of Propel every morning. One of those big 24 oz. guys. But I'm all out, so I decided to stop by the gas station on my way to work and pick one up. But the fountain soda was calling to me with it's promise of sweetness and caffeine. I folded to temptation and got myself a big 'ole diet soda. 

I took it up to the counter, put it down, and started fishing around in my pocket for some cash. The attendant on duty asked "What else ya got?" "That's it," I replied. She smiled at me and said "Ya know what, I got this one today. Have a good day, sweetie." I'm sure my face lit up. I asked her if she was sure, and she assured me she was. So I thanked her and went on my way. 

I can't remember the last time I was the subject of a random act of kindness, but this sure was a great way to start the day that I'm sure will end even better.
