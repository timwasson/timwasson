Well, I got my demo reel all ready to go. I spent a few hours at Kinko's, my favorite place on Earth and a former employer, printing out business cards, my new resume, and labels for my demo reel and box. That took much longer than expected, so it was 3:00 before I even got to use my handy self-made list of video production houses in Peoria. I went to all the places in Peoria that I knew how to get to before finally calling it quits at around 5, figuring most places were closing and didn't want to talk to me.

If there is a hell worse that cold-visits, I don't know what in the world it could possibly be.

It's not quite as bad as I'm making it out to be, I suppose, but it's pretty... I don't know the right word. But walking into a production house, claiming to be a freelancer and begging people to read your resume and look at your demo reel... it's a bit not fun, if you can imagine that.

I stopped by and was talking to this one guy, really nice fella. Our conversation went like this:

"I've spent the last year at the Iona Group... I don't know if you've heard of them."  
"Oh yeah, I've heard of them."  
"Right, well, I've been working there a year, but they wouldn't let me put any of the video work I've done for them on my demo reel. They said it would violate copyright regulations or something."  
"Yeah, that's not why. It's because they're just mean."

So, I guess the Iona thing left a bad taste in his mouth. But he was impressed by what I had to offer, I guess. I dropped off 3 demo reels and resumes total, and no one watched the tape while I was there. Hopefully I'll start getting calls soon. We'll see.

The last few days have been uneventful at best. This weekend I did virtually nothing, barely leaving the apartment. It's fun to have no money sometimes, but when you really want to go out and have a good time, being broke blows.
