I'm at work, but again, not working. Usually I've wasted my days by reading forums, but today I'm trying something different...

...I'm updating my webpage. Sure, not the most exciting way to spend a day, but being productive makes things go very quickly. Look, it's almost 11. The day has flown by so far, seriously. 

Last night I ate buffalo wings ($3/lb. night), then watched part of 3 Kings with a few friends. Pretty standard. Tonight I don't think I'll be going out. I want to sit at home for a night or 2. But, I've said that before and went out anyway. But not tonight, damn it.
