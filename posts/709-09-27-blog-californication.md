California was fantastic, if I may say so. It was good to see Brice again, and good to realize that even though a lot of him and his life has changed, deep down he's the same old guy I was such good friends with so many years ago. The wedding was nice, the reception was fun, and the most important part of the wedding is that [I caught the garter][1] for the first time ever. 

So anyway, it was a long few days of travel, not a lot of sleep, and ridiculous schedule. I've got a few days to recover, and I'll need them. After sleeping over 10 hours last night, I realized I could have slept a whole lot more. It was tough waking up today.
