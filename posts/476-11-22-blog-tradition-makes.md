Tradition makes this wings and beer night at my place. Yee haw. 

I probably won't be posting again until Monday, but I wanted to wish you all a Happy Thanksgiving. For those of you, like me, who have a 4 day weekend, enjoy it. For those of you who don't... well, sucks to be you. 

Peace out. Have a good break.
