Remember as a kid when you'd count the days until Christmas and make lists of stuff for people to buy you? Well things are a little different now. My family asked me for some gift ideas and I came up with nothin'. Really, I think I'd prefer to get nothing, as that would relieve some pressure for me to buy them something. Times change, huh?

In any case, we're 5 days from the big day and I really couldn't care less. I'm a little worried about Christmas shopping, as I've only spent a couple of hours doing it and have only bought for about half the people I need to buy for. But otherwise, Christmas will just be another day. I guess this is what it feels like to be an adult, huh?
