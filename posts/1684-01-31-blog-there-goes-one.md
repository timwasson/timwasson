&nbsp;So, here we are, end of January and I've only done 1 blog entry. So, that resolution hasn't been super awesome. But I still gotta try.&nbsp;

I'm working out a lot harder in the new year. Four times per week with a personal trainer, and my days off I go on a run when I can. The days I train with my trainer are especially helpful. I do feel in better shape now. Certainly not the best shape of my life, but give it a few more months and maybe I will be.&nbsp;

Hill's pregnancy is going great. Its weird to be getting so excited at a growing belly and reading about the development process. Its getting really interesting now, but I know it'll only get more interesting as things develop further.
