Every once in a while, I get the feeling that the world can't really get any worse. People who are supposed to be close to you crap all over the relationship, people lie, steal, cheat, manipulate, kill, hurt, and destroy. People will stab each other in the back for a bigger paycheck or for revenge or jealousy. But then something happens that makes me think that maybe people ain't so bad. This weekend I went out to lunch with my family to a restaurant with no good visible windows. While eating, it started to rain. I, of course, had no idea. I saw the wet ground as we were leaving and immediately remembered I'd left my windows down. 

As I got closer to the Jeep, I saw the windows were actually up. Huh, I thought, I must have rolled them up and just forgotten about it. But there was a bit of rain that had accumulated inside. The only explanation is that it started raining, and some stanger stood out in the rain just to roll up the windows on a strangers car. No opportunity for a thank you, or a cash reward. He just did it to be a nice guy and make someone's afternoon suck a little bit less. As silly as it sounds, it really meant a lot to me. 

In other news, things keep really going my way lately. Details to follow. Eventually.
