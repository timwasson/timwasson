So, I just got the call. I got the job at the art gallery. 

In one way it's good. I get free inspiration by framing artwork all day. I'm sure I'll get discounts on framing my own stuff. I don't have to work with customers.

The bad part: I don't really want to go back to the whole 9-5 routine. I'll only get $7/hour. I made $7/hour when I was 17. I made $16/hour at Iona. 

But, hopefully it will lead to something better. We'll see.
