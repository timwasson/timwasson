That pretty much says it all.

I spent a lot of my time last night working on [hidethecam.com][1], since I'm getting more and more visitors, and the site was a bit "quirky", to put it lightly. I put in a few hours last night, just to get it working correctly, and it should be up and running like a champ now.

At some point in the evening, I remembered that Unbreakable and Dogma: Special Edition had come out, so I ran to Best Buy to pick them up. Unfortunately Dogma was sold out, so I just got Unbreakable. It was way past my bed time when I got home, so I didn't get a chance to watch it. 

Tonight I'm supposed to go out with Missy, although I don't know if that will happen. Tomorrow night is Brice's last night here, so we're going to Garner's. 

I haven't put the top back on my Jeep since Sunday night.

The end.
