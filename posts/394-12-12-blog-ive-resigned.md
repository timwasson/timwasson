I've resigned to the fact that my life will be at a constant state of "doing stuff" until after the holidays. For a guy who hates doing stuff as much as I do, its a hard pill to swallow. I'm having fun, but I'm also really looking forward to laying on my couch watching TV for a night without feeling like I'm missing something. 

This weekend I went to a bowling party with a bunch of 4-6 year olds, had a turkey fry, cut down a Christmas tree, and had some pizza out in Farmington while sort of watching a football game. Pictures will be coming soon. Maybe.
