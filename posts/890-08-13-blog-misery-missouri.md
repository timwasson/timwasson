I do think I'm going to make a fantastic dad. Someday. Not today though.

This weekend was spent in Missouri with the whole family, nephews and niece included. It was a long car ride and a whole, whole lot of "togetherness". I consider myself a really patient guy, and I love my nephews and niece like they're my own, but man... 3 days of it, and I was beat up. 

Anyway, now it's back to the real world after a little vacation that was about as far away from a relaxing break as one could get. 

About 2 weeks away from our big Rue Morgue article! I'm pumped to see how that thing turned out.
