As noted by Bryan and Jaimee's journals, New Years Eve was an excellent time. I got driz-unk and partied like a rock star, all without throwing up. I did comeclose a few times, and I sure did feel really shitty the next morning, but I managed to keep the liquer down. I've also noticed that hangovers don't last as long when you're in better shape. There's a tip for everyone interested.

I should go into work today, but I don't think I'm going to. I need to clean this joint up, and my dad is coming over at 5 so we can start on our big money making experience. I'll go in tomorrow. 

So, the big New Years Resolution this year seems to be to lose weight and get in shape. I'd also like to add myself to that ever growing list. I want to lose 30 more pounds and be "in shape" for the first time in my life. I don't really know what "in shape" means, but I have a small list of feats I'd like to be able to accomplish by the time I'm through with this whole dieting thing.

I'd also like to buy a house, get a consistent paycheck somehow, and stop being so god damn poor all the time.
