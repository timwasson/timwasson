Angie and I watched The Manchurian Candidate last night. I didn't really know what to expect going into the movie. I knew it was a remake of an old movie, and I knew it was sort of political. As a general rule, I stay away from political movies because they're boring and I usually don't understand them. So anyway, I thought this was a pretty cut and dry political type movie, but then it broke into all sorts of weird brainwashing-implanted-computer-chip-mind-control-vice-president-killer type stuff. I don't think I cared for the movie, but I was so blind sighted by everything that I'm not quite certain. Did the previews make it out to be as odd as it was? I don't recall.

So then I went to bed and had the coolest scariest dream I've had in a while. It was my standard nightmare of accidently killing someone, then spending the rest of the dream running from the cops who are hot on my trail. But in this one, I didn't actually kill anyone, but everyone thought I had. So Mullens, Alan and I took off on a quest to prove me innocent and in the process stole trucks and ate sandwiches and other cool stuff. I'm pretty convinced this crazy bizarre dream would make a sweet movie, although it would be one of those sweet movies that most people hate and only like 16 people would love, but then those 16 make t-shirts and quote from it constantly and are so relieved and excited when they run into another person that loves the movie as much as they do and understand the quotes that they can't stop saying.
