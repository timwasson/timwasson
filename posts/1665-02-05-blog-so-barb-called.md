So, Barb called me up on Friday night. We have a long, not so pleasant past, and she's been trying her best to be my friend again. She's even gone so far as to invite me to be in her wedding party. Weird. Anyway, she wanted to go out with me, but I told her I had no money. She treated me to bowling and dinner, which was nice.

Barb and I aren't friends in any kind of "real" sense. We go out, she spends all her time complaining about her fiancee, her mom, telling me how much she misses her dad, and basically all the reasons why her life sucks. At the end of the night she thanks me for helping her feel better. That happens once about every other month. It's fine with me, I guess... if it keeps her sane and feeling okay, then I'm glad to do it. She always proposes other plans, like wanting me to take her out to the bars on her 21st, but those never work out, and probably never will. I'm a reluctant friend, I suppose. 

Anyway, that was Friday night. On Saturday Alan and I got some beers and sat around and drank and watched some TV. It was a fun weekend for me, I guess, considering how free it was. Superbowl Sunday Mullens came over and brought a bunch of pizza, and we just chilled and watched the game. Piece of trivia for you: Superbowl 36 was the first and only football game I have sat down and watched in it's entirity. We also made plans to go down to New Orleans for Mardi Gras. Those plans depend on me getting my check from Iona. No check, no money, no Mardi Gras. We'll see what happens there.

Yesterday I bitched at my programmer a bit and went out to my parent's to do some laundry. Exciting stuff, I tell you. Today my programmer emailed me saying his portion of the site will be ready to go by the end of the day. I'm not holding my breath, but I am getting pretty excited.
