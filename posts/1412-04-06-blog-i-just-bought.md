I just bought a bunch of sweet ass toys from eBay from other countries. A 2" Optimus Prime from Japan, a 20" Optimus Prime from Canada, and a Superman and Batman set from China. 

I love eBay and the toys she gives me, but I hate waiting. Especially when shipping from other countries. I just want my toys.
