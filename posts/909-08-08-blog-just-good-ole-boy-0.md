So, Dukes of Hazzard was pretty much the dumbest, awesomest, most entertaining movie I've seen in a long, long time. I loved it. 

Anyway, on Friday Angie, Mullens, Anna, and I went to see the movie, followed by some drinks at Jimmy's and down town. I stayed out way late, but had a good time. Saturday I had to run out to my parents' house to take care of their cat while they're on vacation. Other than that, I didn't do much all day. I went to Hooters and Old Chicago with Alan for lunch and dinner respectively, and I was in bed and asleep by 10:30. I'd had a big night the night before. 

Yesterday Alan threw a small pool party at his house. I drank some beers and ate some cheddar wursts and did some "swimming", if you can call it that. And now I'm back at work.
