Yesterday was absolutely frustrating.

Worked sucked, as per usual. I just wanted to go home and get to sleep. I spent most of the day doing mindless busy work and complaining the whole time. Which is fun and all, don't get me wrong. 

After work I had to go take care of Brice's dog, then I had to go take care of my own dog, then I had to go to my aunt's. I've been helping her with her computer for the past few months, and it's a horrible, horrible experience every time. I'm a pretty patient guy, but I absolutely hate going over everything 2,000 times before she pretends to understand, only to ask me about it 3 seconds later. But such is life.

Finally I got to go home, and I had a message from Steph. I called her up, and we went out to eat at good old Long John Silvers. Here's a weird story. We were in Circuit City looking at DVDs, and I see one in the bargain section... Little Shop of Horrors. Now obviously I'm pretty excited at this point... I love that movie, and I think it's because I have a strange fascination with Rick Moranis and his movies, especially Honey I Shrank the Kids. But I digress. So here's Little Shop of Horrors in the bargain section for $7. I grab it off the shelf, expecting to see Steve Martin and Rick Moranis, but who do I see but... Jack Nicholson? Confused, I flip the case over. Apparently this was Roger Corman's first movie, and I'm a pretty big fan of Roger's B-rated cult classics. It was made in 1960, starred Jack, and inspired the Broadway musical that inspired the 1986 film, which was actually a remake of this one. How nutty. I haven't gotten a chance to watch it, but I'm more curious than I can even express in words.

So, today Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? comes out on DVD. Steph and I are going to watch that tonight. All of you should watch too.

Ah, in more depressing news, [hidethecam's][1] hits are going down, down, down. I have to finish that thing and get to promoting quick.
