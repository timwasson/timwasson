Briefly that is. I just remembered, just now.

Last night's events... 

Went to my place. Returned some phone calls from some annoying people I don't really want to hang out with. But... one came over and was obnoxious, as per usual. Then 2 people I wanted to come over came over. They helped themselves to my food, which was annoying. They used my phone without asking, which was annoying. They had greasy nasty hands and felt free to wipe them on my new couches. Of course a lot of the grease wound up on my phone as well. Then they tried to take over my TV, insulting what I was watching, and wouldn't give me back my cool ass remote control. One of them went outside, into my courtyard, to smoke and left the door open, so it was butt ass cold when I went to bed. While preparing my food for themselves, one set off my fire alarm (because nothing needs to be cooked at 550 degrees). I told him "hit the button to turn it off", but instead he ripped it out of my ceiling for no good reason. I had to put it back because he's too short. I tried to drop hints that I wanted to be left alone, since I was annoyed to hell by my stupid visitors, but they didn't get it and stuck around pretty much forever. It wasn't a good night. Tonight I will chill, by myself, with no company. I will not answer my phone or return phone calls. That's bitchy, isn't it? Ah well...
