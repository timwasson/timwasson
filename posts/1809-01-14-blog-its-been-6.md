It's been an eventful couple of days, I guess. 

On Saturday Mullens called me, letting me know that he's been called up from reserve to active duty as of today. Kind of shocking for someone like me who doesn't keep up on the news or have any clue what's going on in the world most of the time. So he ships out on Saturday at the earliest. On Sunday and yesterday there were some gatherings to wish him a safe trip and such.

My plan was to not go out drinking or go out to eat until Fabish's bachelor party, which is on Saturday. But this kind of threw a wrench into those plans. I'm sure everything will work out in a good way, but still.

In other news, I got my new digital camera, which is pretty much the awesomest camera ever. I love it.

And in still other news, I've been trying extra hard to reverse the damages that New Years and Christmas did to my belly. I gained about 5 or 6 pounds in about 12 days of drinking too much, eating way too much, and no exercise. But those damaged have been reversed now, and that was confirmed when I stepped on the scale this morning to see I weighed in at an amazing 199. That's right, kiddies, I'm strolling triumphantly back into the 100's! Barely, but still.

Tonight I'm forcing myself to eat broccoli.
