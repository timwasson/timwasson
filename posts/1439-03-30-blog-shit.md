Well, I had many things planned to do today. Unfortunately, I probably won't get around to doing them. Why, you ask? Because I have a feeling those viruses I've been getting have been doing more damage than I originally thought. I bought some Antivirus software to check, but it won't let me install it. I'm blaming this on the virus I may or may not have. Other little annoyances have been popping up since I started getting the emails, so I figure a reinstall is my best bet at this point. Shit. 

Anyway, I'll be backing stuff up as to not lost anything important for the next couple hours, then reinstalling for a few hours after that. Wish me luck.
