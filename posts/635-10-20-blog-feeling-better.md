So, I tell ya what. When life hands ya lemons, you make lemonaide with them.&nbsp; 

I've been more productive, more social, and more who I want to be in the last few weeks. After months of feeling trapped, in a sense, I feel out. Eager to make stuff happen. I'm meeting new people, having a great time, and turning a bad situation (one of the worst) into a great situation. 

Anyway, I'm feeling better, and ready to get this nerd blog back on track to nerd stuff instead of complaining stuff.
