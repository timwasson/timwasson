Boyz night out with Polk last night was fantastic. Less fantastic is that I've spent the last 3 nights between work and pitch black darkness vacuuming leaves, blowing leaves, raking leaves, kicking leaves, and sometimes yelling at leaves. I have a very small yard with 2 very leafy trees. The cleaning process is ridiculous. 

Bowling Monday was good, except that I lost to Angie. Twice. In a row. Humiliating.
