I'm going to be an uncle. Amazing, no? My sister has been married about a year and a half and I've been pestering her to have kids since they got married. She kept saying she wanted to wait a few years, but I'm so glad she didn't. She's about 9 weeks pregnant, and the baby is due January 9th. How exciting. 

In other news, me and Steph went to eat at a Chinese restaurant last night, then Angie came over and we watched part of Raising Arizona, until I got really stupidly tired. Steph went home and I went to bed. That was my night.

Tonight is the last Friday night that Brice will be in town, so we're celebrating with a little get together at my place.
