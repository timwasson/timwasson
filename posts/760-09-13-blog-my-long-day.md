My long day.

I did a lot of work today. I made a lot of phone calls, and I went to this one guy's house to take pictures for this Quicktime VR thing I have to do for work. I accidently left my camera there, and boy am row and see if I can get it. Stupid, stupid me. 

However, I did get [this][1] done.

I also almost got the Quicktime VR thing done, but I can't stop from worrying about that camera. I hope frost and/or dew doesn't fuck it up.
