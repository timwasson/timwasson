This update is late on account of me not being able to log on earlier for some odd reason.

This update is also uninteresting, since there's nothing to update. 

Fabish and Angie are still on Spring Break, so Garner's last night was just going to be me and Mullens. Mullens called at the last minute saying he was sick, so he wasn't going. I just got a pizza delivered and watched a special on the first 24 days of Survivor 2. Now I'm all caught up.

That's about it. I hope you weren't expecting too much.
