I am so bad at being a salesman. I am really, really horrible. I should get on the phone right now and call up my potential clients and bug them for work. I should make little memos and send them out in the hopes of landing a few more jobs. I just can't bring myself to do it for some reason.

Things are starting to come together, though. I can feel it in the air... soon I will be a millionaire.

We better get some Trick or Treaters tonight, damn it. I spent like $10 on candy for them. The neighborhood kids know us... hopefully they'll come around.
