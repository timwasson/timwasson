Well, I finally got the major sections of tim.cx skinned and looking pretty and working pretty well in FireFox and IE and Mac and PC, although there will still need to be some tweaking and some graphics thrown in in certain areas. Oh yeah, and more content. If its not too troubling, please leave some comments on pictures or blog entries and see if everything is working okay (For LJer's, the site is [here][1]).
