Dear people I eat dinner and drink beers with every Friday,,

I've decided my Christmas present to you guys is to buy you all dinner and drinks tonight. I reckon this will be my last Friday before Christmas that I'll actually be available, so you better take advantage of my offer tonight. No rainchecks will be issued.

Wolfie, even though you never come on Fridays, if you're off tonight the offer extends to you. And Tiffany. Okay, anyone reading this who I know in real life, if you want a free dinner give me a call.

Sincerely,  
Santa

PS- I may not be able to make it at 6:00 tonight. Perhaps we can push the start time back?
