So, I got a link from [http://www.memepool.com][1], and with it came a lot of other good stuff. The Screen Savers possibility, and this:

A friend of mine emailed me your link, beautiful work! My name is Jonathan  
and I  
am the Editor of a Design, Art and Architecture magazine called Textfield.  
We are currently working on our second issue, and I would like to know if  
you would be interested  
in an article on your Nintendo Computer, perhaps and interview or simpy  
publication of your  
tutorial?

Yeah, it's all about the NES PC, but it's an art magazine! Maybe if I get my foot in the door there, I can whore myself to them and their readers as an artist rather than a computer nerd. Everything's comin' up Wasson.
