I took the morning off for a visit to the dentist's office. I'm more scared than I should be about it. This is partly because I haven't been to the dentist in like 8 years and I'm worried I'll have cavaties for the first time in my life. It's also partly because I'm worried he'll tell me I need my wisdom teeth removed.

I remember when my dad got his wisdom teeth out. I was in preschool. He spent a few days laying on the couch, spitting blood into a bucket. Mullens got dry socket and randomly spat/swollowed blood. I haven't talked to anyone yet who said the experience was pleasant. Oh, it's also expensive.

It will be good to be able to eat again though. Yeah. That'll be nice.

Anyone have any "it wasn't so bad getting my wisdom teeth out" stories?

Edit- Done with my first visit. Yeah, my wisdom teeth are impacted and they're what's causing me this horrible pain. Yes, I need to get them removed, and have set up a consultation for next week to do so. Yeah, it will still be expensive but mostly covered by insurance because of the aforementioned impaction. 

The good news: Still no cavaties. The doctor kept saying how I must have strong and healthy teeth, and was shocked when I told him I only brush once a day and do no other kind of maintenance to them. It was the same reaction I always got as a kid.
