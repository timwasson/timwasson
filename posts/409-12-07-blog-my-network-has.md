My network has been down all day, so this entry is a tad late. I'm sure you'll get over it eventually.

Despite what you naysayers said about me not going to bed early, you were wrong. Actually, it was just one naysayer, but you were still wrong. I had wings at my place, kicked my visitors out by 9 and was fast asleep in my bed by 9:30. So there. 

And that was my night. Tonight I'm heading home and eating dinner with my parents. It should be a blast.

That was sarcasm. But at least it will be free.
