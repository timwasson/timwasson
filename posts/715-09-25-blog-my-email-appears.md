My email appears to be down, which is no fun at all.

I had planned on not producing any more Bruce/Sam VCDs, but I got a lot of orders in a short amount of time, so I'm making more. That little project has done great things for me. Hopefully I can think of a few more clever ideas and sell those on CD or, better yet, some form of eBook or something.

I'm cleaning my apartment now, but getting bored with it really quickly. Cleaning is no fun at all.

My sister seems a bit upset that she hasn't seen my new apartment yet. I keep telling her that this is the most generic apartment of all time, but it doesn't phase her much. 

My fasting hasn't been doing so well. I go about 16 hours each time before I get an offer for free food. In the past few days, my dad has bought me dinner, Bibo bought me a late lunch, and mom bought me lunch just a couple minutes ago. I do want to fast for 72 hours, but I'll be damned if I give up free food for the cause. I mean, it's free.

Thus endeth an incredibly random entry.
