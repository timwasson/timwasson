On my way to work this morning, my fancy schmance digital thermometer thing read -11. It's ridiculously, dangerously cold out there. 

So the Bears lost. I was rooting for them only in the most superficial sense. I mean, I would have preferred that they won of course, but I find it pretty difficult to give a shit one way or the other about sports. So they lost, but life goes on, and I'm completely unaffected by it. Although it was pretty sweet when the Bears scored on the kick off... first time in Superbowl history, I'm told. 

Oh, and a town closish to here got hit by a meteor! Or was it a meteorite? That's way more interesting to me than the Superbowl.
