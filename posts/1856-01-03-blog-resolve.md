I have many resolutions this year. The one I have every year is to get my weight under control. I tend to gain and lose significant amounts of weight on a yearly basis, and am currently at the most I've weighed in a while. Its not that I want to be as skinny as I was 2 summers ago (I looked kind of grotesquely skinny to be honest). I want to get to a healthy weight, then stay there instead of this up-and-down nonsense. Its for the birds.

The other goals I have are related to my big news that isn't quite ready to share with the world just yet. Hang tight for that one. 

The other resolution I've had for a long time is to get my finances under control. I think I've finally succeeded there. My credit cards are paid off, except for my Christmas spending of course, which shouldn't take much time to pay off. My expenses are cut down to a reasonable level. I'm still a paycheck-to-paycheck kind of guy, but I do think I've got a handle on it.

Life is good.
