title: So I have

So, I have this ecommerce site. It's a failed project. While I haven't completely given up on it, I've accepted the fact that I will never make back my initial investment, and the page will never take off and do well. The site cost me about $5,000 to set up, plus close to 100 hours working on it. So far, it's made $17.

In an effort to not give up on my dream of making a website to make me money, I threw together [http://www.freegreenstuff.com][1] in about 20 minutes and spent about $100 promoting it. I now have about 30 referrals and about 120 secondary referrals. That means that if they use the service for an hour a day, I get about $300/month. Not too shabby, eh? Strange how that works out sometimes.
