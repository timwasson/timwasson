Man, my Nintendo computer is freaking awesome. Last night I took it into the living room and watched Queen of the Damned on my big screen, playing off the computer's hard drive. Man, that movie was so terrible that it wasn't even worth the time it took to download. Luckily I'm too poor to buy DVDs these days, and at least I didn't waste money on it. But either way, it was still nice to not have to decode and re-encode, then burn to 2 VCDs. Higher quality and less of a pain in my ass. Go Nintendo. I can't wait to build one I actually keep.

There's a lot of interest on eBay with like 6,863 hits, but only 1 bid. 

Today I'm cleaning my apartment. It's a big job.
