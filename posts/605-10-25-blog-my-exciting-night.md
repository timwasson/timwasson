I avoided doing anything last night on purpose. I had fallen behind on all the DVDs I've been buying and not watching, so I took last night off. I didn't drink any beer, but instead just watched some movies. I was in bed by 9:15. I think I'm more awake today. 

That, of course, means I can stay out too late tonight and drink too much beer. I like catching up on my sleep, but I also like going out. I guess I need to find the happy medium. I don't think I've found that.

Tonight is $3/pound wing night at my favorite wing restaurant. I bet I can stuff down 3 pounds if I try hard enough.
