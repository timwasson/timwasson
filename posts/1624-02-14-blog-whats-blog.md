I guess I forgot about the existence of this blog, or at least its purpose of... ya know... updating stuff. It's been weeks since I've had anything interesting to say I guess. 

My life has really just been work, work, work, and more work lately. The only really social things I've had a sliver of time for are hanging out with Hill, the occasional outing with people from work, and of course dodgeball. 

The extra money is nice, but the goal I'm working towards is even nicer. Of course I'm not going to stop being ambiguous about that right now, but by the end of the month I will. For seriously.
