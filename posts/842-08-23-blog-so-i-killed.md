So I killed some time last night before Brian and Smalls got there to help me finish up my computer and hopefully get me back online. I got this huge fan for my processor, which unfortunately didn't fit. We made a last minute trip to Best Buy and got one that's slightly too small for the computer. I may have to rig something up to keep it cooler, since... well, it seems like a good idea.

We got one computer up and running as well as it's going to run (the 700 Celeron I just bought), but it only has a 4X CDROM, since I took the fast one out to put in my new computer and the 4X was leftover from my old Pentium II. Anyway, everything is up and running well, with the exception of a few simple things. Like my second video card isn't supported by WIN2K, so I'll need to replace it with one that is. My ethernet adapter isn't working (which means still no internet), and my sound card isn't working. By tonight hopefully all the bugs will be worked out. I'm taking Brian out to eat Chinese tonight and maybe to a movie or something as a thank you. 

In any case, I was up way too late last night fiddling... 'til around 2:30 or so. Normally not a big deal but I had to wake up at 7:45 this morning. I don't do good on less than 7 hours of sleep. 

Today is the "production outing" for my company, which means we production folk go and eat lunch outside and play softball. I'm not really looking forward to it.
