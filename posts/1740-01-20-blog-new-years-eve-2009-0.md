I know I have done a pretty poor job of keeping up with my resolution to type in this here blog more often. But I'll remedy that with this post which has a video AND a photo gallery!

New Year's Eve this year was spent watching the Dualing Pianos show with my lovely wife, Keith, Missy, Amy, Sandy, Dino, Nick and Diane. Some of us were split at different tables and different groups, but we all met up at different times of the night when the pianos weren't playing.

Anyway, it was a fun night full of free drinks, expensive songs, fireworks and good friends. Enjoy the video and the [photo gallery][1].
