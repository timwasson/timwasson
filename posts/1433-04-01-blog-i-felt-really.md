I felt really, really terrible last night. I think it was a combination of being half-sick, then going to my aunt and uncle's house where everyone smokes. I inhaled about 3 packs worth, which made me miserable. When I got home, I watched Simpsons but could barely keep my eyes open. I forced myself to stay awake until 9, when I finally went to bed.

And here it is, 4 AM, and I've woken up and I'm not tired at all. That sucks. And my throat is killing me and I'm sure I have a fever. Fuck you, sickness. Fuck you to hell.
