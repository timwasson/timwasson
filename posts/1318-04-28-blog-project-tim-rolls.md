The Input Machineprogress rolls on. I've now added commenting ability to the blog, as well as a mostly-site wide template. The problem is drawing the line of where to stop before Project TIM makes its debut. There's so many ideas I keep having, but I think my focus at the moment needs to be tightening up security and making this script easy to install and use before adding new and fascinating features. But adding new features is way more fun than tweaking code.
