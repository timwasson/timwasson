I'd hoped it was an April Fool's Day joke, but the article Wolfie linked to appears to be written before April 1st. It looks like my&nbsp; favorite stand up comic has kicked the bucket, way before his time. It's a sad day. I'll now leave you with my favorite Mitch Hedberg quote of all time.

"I bought a doughnut and they gave me a receipt for the doughnut. I don't need a receipt for the doughnut - I'll just give you money and you give me the doughnut. End of transaction. We don't need to bring ink and paper into this. I can't imagine a scenario in which I would need to prove that I bought a doughnut. Some skeptical friend... donâ€™t even act like I didn't buy a doughnut, I've got the documentation right here. Oh wait, it's back home in the file... under "D", for doughnut."
