Okay, so the latest on the house is this.

The current owner is being foreclosed. As a result, the bank wants to close really, really, really soon. How soon, you ask? March 17th. So things are going to have to be kicked up a notch, here. It's delayed even more since the current owner is out of town and can't fill out the necessary paperwork. 

So, that kind of sucks. I guess I don't know what else to say about it. If we close on March 1st, the current owner is definitely going to have to keep living there, at least for a little while. As long as she pays me rent, that's fine. If she doesn't pay me rent, then I'm kicking her out, since come March 17th, the house is MINE. 

This is turning into a pain in the ass, but it will be worth it once I move in.
