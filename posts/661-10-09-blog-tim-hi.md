Tim,

Hi, this is Jonathan Short from 89.1 WIDR-FM is Kalamazoo. I'm the  
producer of a show called Super-Pop here at the station, and we generally  
interview authors, musicians, film directors, etc. However, on the 22nd of  
October we're interviewing the author of the book "Hacking the X Box"  
and thought that perhaps a short (10-15 minutes?) pre-recorded phone  
interview with you about your NES PC would be a great companion piece  
for a hardware modding theme. It could act as a good, free method of  
promoting your site and product, and would be of great interest to our  
listeners.

Let me know if you're interested, and we can arrange a good time to do the interview.

Cheers,  
Jonathan  
89.1 WIDR-FM

Awesome. Awesome.
