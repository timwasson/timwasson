I'm sharing my internet connection with my neighbor. I have DSL and a router, and I had an open space, so we ran a cable and badda-boom, it's a shared connection. It's nice because we split the internet bill, so we both get cheap, fast access. 

Well, tonight Doug came by to pay me for the connection and then asked me to unplug his cable from my router for the next couple of days. He says his girlfriend has been online way too much and it's pissing him off. He wants her to get away from the computer to clean the apartment and such. I thought it was pretty funny. 

I'm running short on funds again. I really wish I had consistent income sometimes.
