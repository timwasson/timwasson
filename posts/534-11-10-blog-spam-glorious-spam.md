I can't believe it! I'm writing a new feature for tim.cx to display the latest comments on the site, and in the process stumbled across several gems like the comments to this photo [right here][1]. Normally I'd be furious, but I'm just excited that someone is visiting. I supposed I should write something to stop automated spambots like that, but for now I just get a kick out of it. Spam me, baby.
