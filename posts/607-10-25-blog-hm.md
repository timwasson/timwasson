Is it too much to ask for my friends to take an active interest in me? I mean an interest beyond asking me questions. An interest that gets to the point of participating in my life. I do that for my friends, and most return the favor. But some don't. 

I don't want them to just "return the favor" to use my own words. I want them to WANT to participate in my life, meet my other friends, know where I live, etc. Maybe I'm the only person who thinks that's important.

To me, asking questions isn't enough. I wish it was.

But oh well. I'm outtie for the day.
