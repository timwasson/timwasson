Ya know, as geeky as I am now, I used to be much more so. Back in high school, I used to dream of the day I'd be able to have high speed internet access and constant instant messaging access. Back then, technology seemed to move so stinkin' slow.

Now... notsomuch. My phone came out of the box with access to several instant messaging programs, and I never really use that feature much. WiFi is getting much more widespread, but I don't leave the house with my laptop... well... ever, really. 

But all this is beside the point. As I prepare for a 7 or 8 hour car ride this weekend, I'm planning ways to kill time on the trip. I'll be bringing my laptop so I can be a little productive, and my iPod with some TV shows and movies on it to kill some time. But the real point to this geekery in this post is that last night I enabled DUN on my phone last night, so I'll be able to surf the web on the car ride there via my cell phone, no cables or anything else necessary. This is the technology that, as a 16 year old, I thought would never, ever arrive. A mere 10 years later, several companies are supplying high speed internet access over cellular connections, and some cities are blanketing the entire city with absolutely free and fast internet access. 

Crazy, crazy world. I tell ya what.
