My good buddy Brian Kelly stopped by Peoria for Easter and gave me a call yesterday. We went out to see Panic Room. I ran into my other good Bryan buddy, Bryan J. Polk. If only I had run into Wolford... it would have been the night I saw all of my Bry(i)an friends.

I also "met" the infamous Jim Kerr, although Polk is rude and never introduced us. 

Panic Room wasn't a fantastic movie, but I thought it was good. Jodie Foster spent a good deal of the movie in those glasses I love, which made her look so freaking hot. 

I came back and had dreams about Halle Berry wanting to date me, but her black friends didn't approve. But I didn't really care, because I didn't want to date her anyway.
