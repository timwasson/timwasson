Last night was great. John Zarr and Brian Kelly came over and we made some small talk and watched some TV before Mullens got there. We ordered Garner's. I ate way too many hot wings, but so did everyone else. 

The premiere of Boot Camp came on, which Mullens was all psyched for. Before the show started, I was pretty sure it would be either a watered down version of boot camp, or an overly dramatic version. It was kind of dramatic, but Mullens said it was pretty accurate. The more I learn about the the real boot camp, the more I'm glad I didn't join any of the armed services. 

After that we watched Slumber Party Massacre II, starring the ever popular Crystal Bernard, of Wings fame. The first hour or so is just a regular horror movie, but then it gets weird. By the end you have no idea what in the world you just watched. It's very bizarre. It's like a good idea gone horribly, horribly wrong. Like an art film no one understands except the person who made it. It's just weird. I've never gotten lost in the plot of a B-rated horror film before. But I digress. 

After the movie Brian decided that he had drank too much to drive home. I didn't agree, but I didn't want to force him to drive either, so we killed an hour by discussing organized religion and how wrong Catholicism is. It was fun. I like heated discussions like that, and I'm not exactly sure why. I think the main reason is that I get to say controversial things that get people like John Zarr pissed off. That's really fun.
