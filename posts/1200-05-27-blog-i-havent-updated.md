I haven't updated in a while, so here's the lowdown on what's been goin' on these past few days. 

Not much.

We met Polk for his birthday dinner one night, and last night we did our regular Hoops thing. I'm really enjoying the "no housework" time we've got goin' on right now, and I'm really looking forward to using this upcoming 3 day weekend to work on a comic book and on Optimus Prime. 

I bought Return of the King at Wal-Mart last night, along with a sweet ass 20" TV for our bedroom to replace the 13" Commodore. Can't beat the price... $75 on clearance. 

Tomorrow Dish gets installed. That'll be sweet, baby.

I've also made a decision that upsets and disappoints me. I think my motorcycle purchase will need to wait until the winter. I think come winter, there will be more motorcycles for sale, they'll be cheaper, and I'll be less in credit card debt. I think if, starting now, I spend every extra penny I make on my credit cards, they'll be paid off by October. That will be a big burden gone, and then I can start saving money. In the meantime, I think I'll spend $120 to get canvas doors for Jeepy so I can take them off easier and pretend that's as good as a motorcycle.
