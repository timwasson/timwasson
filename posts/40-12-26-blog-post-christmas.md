Forget everything I said about how much Christmas has been ruined. I take it all back. Christmas is great, but I'm still glad its over.

I think I did well in both giving AND getting. I got the perfect combination of useful and practical, as well as useless and fun. It was good. 

I saw my family, kind of saw some of my friends, and spent at least a couple hours on my couch not doing anything, which has become very precious time in my very busy life. 

In other, non-Christmas related news for once, big changes are happening in this life of mine, and I'm very, very, very excited for them. More announcements coming soon, but for now I'm falling asleep every night happy as can be, dreaming of how great my life will be in a few short months. Ah....
