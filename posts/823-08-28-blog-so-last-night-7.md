So, last night Angie and I met Chris and Katie at the boat so he could show me how to gamble properly before my trip to Vegas. After not being able to get a seat at the $5 Blackjack table, we made our way to Roulette. Let me preface this story by saying I had absolutely no idea what I was doing as I stepped up to the table and bought my chips. My $20 bought me a stack of just 4 $5 chips. I put 2 on black. 1 on a random row at the bottom. 1 on a random space inside. I could have easily lost every single dollar on this first spin, and as Chris explained my rookie mistakes (starting with getting $5 chips instead of $1), the dealer put the little ball in the little wheel thing. I ended up hitting every single square I had money on. I thought I'd doubled my money, which sounded good to me. Chris went pretty crazy at my luck and I kind of shrugged it off. Until he explained to me that the $5 chip I randomly threw in the middle had 35 to 1 odds and I'd be getting back nearly $200 from this first spin ever. An hour and a half later I had turned that $200 into $275 before I decided to stop while I was way, way, way ahead. Overall, I'd say gambling RULES. 

Kouri's was on Friday with a few people who don't show up nearly enough, which was awesome. Later that night, I had a few beers with Monica and Emily and a few a little while later with Alan and Jenny. 

Today is a fried chicken lunch and a whole lotta nothing after that. It should be a good time.
