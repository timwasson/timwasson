Ah, sweet rain. A sign of Spring, and also a sign that I won't get another god damn customer for the rest of my work day. 

I went jogging this morning and found myself locked out of the house when I got home. I took the oppurtunity to do some yard work and talk to the one and only Kouri's Jen who was taking her baby on a walk as I raked up some weeds in the front yard. It was an eventful morning.

Jaimee got her car, so she's able to come and go as she pleases now. We got a great deal on it and it should be a good car for a while. 

Exciting news on the job front... I applied to a job I saw on monster.com thinking I didn't stand much of a chance, but then got an email from the HR department asking my salary requirements. I take that as a good sign. Ever since, I've been thinking about nothing else because I'm so eager to get out of this crap shit fuck ass dick hole cunt lick job. 

I'm going to go pee now.

I'm hungry.
