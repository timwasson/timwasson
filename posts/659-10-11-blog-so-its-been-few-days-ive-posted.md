I guess not a whole lot has happened this week. I went to work. On my days off, I worked on my Nintendo computer. I'm close to getting my Nintendo controller working with a computer, which will be really sweet once it's done. 

I don't know why I didn't mention this when it happened, but I guess I got all wrapped up in my birthday posts and whatnot. The day before my birthday, me and Mullens went out for some drinks. It was just me and him, and we had a big heart to heart about our falling out that happened about a year and a half ago. I think both of us had some things we wanted to get off our chests, and it was a really good way to do it. We were both completely honest even as we said not-nice things to each other, and there weren't any interruptions or raising of voices. It was a good thing all around. 

In the end, he said he wanted us to go back to the way we were when we were 19 and 20. Best friends. Called each other all the time. Did everything together. I told him that was impossible, and that I would never trust him again the way that I trusted him back then. But that doesn't mean I don't like the kid. I do. I think he's a great guy and I really like hanging out with him. It's nice to be friends again, but even though I've forgiven, I'm having a really hard time forgetting. 

On Wednesday, Mullens told me that Angie was really hurt that I haven't had the same talk with her. I'd be more than happy to discuss everything with her, too, but I don't feel any kind of responsibility to call her up out of the blue to talk about it. I guess that's part of the difference. It meant enough to Mullens to call me up and start hanging out with me again, and then to initiate a long discussion about why we aren't the way we used to be. Angie is content to sit there and complain about not being friends, but doesn't care enough to do anything about it. 

Ever since the falling out, I've made an effort to put myself out there for them and reciprocate anything they were willing to do. Whenever either invited me somewhere, I'd go. When they called, I'd call them back. I think that's my job. Reciprocation. Not initiation. Like I said, I haven't forgotten what happened, and I'm still really hurt every time I think about it. As far as I'm concerned, they're the ones who messed up and now it's their job to fix it as best they can. Mullens has. Angie complains that I haven't. But anyway.

This Wednesday, Jody and Alan joined me and Mullens at Hoops, which was a good time. Jody is a cool girl, and it's always good to see Alan again.
