It's been a long few days. 

Thursday I did yard work, then I went to work, then I went to Jimmy's to celebrate my new job. Friday I did yard work, rescued Jaimee's dog when it ran away, then went to work, then out to Donnelly's. Today I did a shit-ton of yard work and have been at work ever since. I'm fucking drained. Yard work is hard, but on the plus side, the bushes and every trace that they ever existed are gone, as are the railroad ties and the elevated yard. It's now one graceful slope, although it is all dirt. Soon there will be sod and a garden, but for now it still looks better than it did 2 weeks ago.

I'm so tired. I could fall asleep right now in my shitty chair.

Since putting in my notice, I've had absolutely no patience for customers. I hate them and I want them to leave me alone. Go away, customers.
