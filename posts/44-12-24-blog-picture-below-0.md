The picture below is my nephew Jack while my parents and I were at my aunt's house. He's trying to show that the green candy he ate turned his mouth green. I'm not sure how well that comes across in the picture.

And while on the subject of my nephews, my nephew Peter got out of the hospital today. He was there for 5 days and is now excited and a tad freaked out to be home. I'm glad his first Christmas will be spent not in a hospital, although now Christmas morning may be moved from my parents' house to my sister's, which means it will be my first Christmas morning ever not spent at home. Well, except that one time when we spent Christmas in Florida when I was like 4 or 5.

Thanks to The Brandon who left me 12 bottles of Christmas joy. They'll be thoroughly enjoyed, for sure. Damn Verizon for messing up my voicemails and making me miss a call from the one and only B. Kelly inviting me to more family festivities. I had to skip out on account of my other plans.
