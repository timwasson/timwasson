Last night I went to my parent's house to eat some tacos. They were good. Then I went to Best Buy. I bought Event Horizon. Then I went home. Then I watched Event Horizon. Later Fabish and KJ stopped by. Later, Molly and Steph stopped by. I finished watching Event Horizon and then I went to bed. It was an exciting night.
