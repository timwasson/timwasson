So, the custom-art.com CD is finished, custom-art.com has been given a facelift, and we're all set to start sellin'. The first round of ads should be going out tonight.

It's nice, because these mods were pretty quick and fairly easy, but the best part... completely free. Free is good. Dave is doing all the promotion and selling for me (for 20% of my profits), and those should be my only expenses. 

I've done the math. I'll need to sell about 450 CDs to make 100% of my money back (once you add in CD cost, cost of inserts, etc.). Dave estimates he can sell 100 CDs a week. I have a hard time believing that, although at this point, my hopes are up.

Now it's to the job at the art gallery. Fun stuff. I guess.
