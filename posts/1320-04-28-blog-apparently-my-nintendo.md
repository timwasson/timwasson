Apparently my Nintendo Computer was published in Electronic Gamers Monthly. Who knew? Not me. A couple magazines have asked me for permission to be printed, but not them. I just checked Walgreens, but they don't have the latest issue. So, please, anyone reading this who has EGM issue 167, can you please scan in page 56 for me? Be a pal.
