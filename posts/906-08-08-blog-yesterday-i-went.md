Yesterday I went out to my parents' house to see Jack and my sister. Jack is the cutest little thing in the world. I brought Winnie, as per usual, and she was walking around begging my mom and dad for food. I said "Winnie, no begging!", at which point Jack started running around the house yelling "No begging! No begging! No begging!". When my sister asked him who I was, he replied "Bill!" and started giggling. I guess that's his idea of a joke. I didn't think it was funny. Anyway, that is one cute kid, right there.

Today is going to be spent cleaning, preparing for Jaimee's first visit to my new house with me living in it. I hate cleaning.
