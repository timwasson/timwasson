I woke up this morning and was going through my daily routine, when my phone rings. It's odd that I get a phone call at 7:30, but regardless I run to pick it up. My caller ID says "Private name, Private number". I figure it's a telemarketer, so I answer in a pissed off "Hello?" Here's the conversation.

"Hello?"  
"Hey."  
"Hi".  
"What are you doing?"  
"umm... nothing...what are YOU doing?"  
"I'm just getting dressed."  
"Cool.... (insert long silence) Who is this?"  
"Who is THIS?"  
"No, who is THIS?"  
"Oh, ya know what, I have the wrong number \*click\*"

Very bizarre. 

Last night I went bowling with a few buddies from high school that I don't see very often. I stayed out a little too late and I'm really, really tired this morning. I need Mountain Dew now.
