Hello world. It's me, Tim. After starting and stopping several blogs, I have settled on my new home at [timwasson.com][1]. This is my personal blog, which means that even though I'll be discussing work, web design, and the pros and cons of being a self-employed freelancer, I'll also be posting lame stories about my nephews or the latest episodes of the various podcasts I participate in.

About 2 months ago, I started fresh in my life. I quit my nice, stable job to pursue a dream of finding something more "me". It wasn't that I was unhappy. It was just that I knew I could be happier. I believe that being comfortable in life is important, but its even more important to not except what fate and luck bring to you. One should never be TOO comfortable in his place in life, and he should be willing to spice things up when appropriate.

This is the second time I've pursued the same dream. The first time I failed miserably and landed in a pit of debt and depression, feeling like the world beat me. I know that re-trying something I failed so horribly at the first time is not the smartest thing in the world to do, but sometimes life isn't about being smart. It's about taking risks and pursuing dreams. I can't imagine working forever at a company and always wondering "what if".

And, let's be honest... as I approach the big 3-0, I realize my opportunities to take risks are getting more limited. These days I need to worry about adult things like insurance, marriage, kids, retirement, future. If I can't make my independent life work now, I'll never be able to.

I hope everyone will follow my new life via this blog. I know it's a one-way conversation right now, but hang tight... comments and other options are coming soon. This is very much a work in progress.
