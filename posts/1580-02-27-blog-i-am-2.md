I am up far too late considering I'm an old man. I ran into a lot of old friends and wonderful people I know and I had a great night. More when I'm not kind of drunk and really flippin' tired. And half sick.

PS - choosing between Alan and Polk as my fake boyfriends is really hard. It all comes down to my facial hair preferences.
