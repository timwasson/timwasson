From one of my admirers who saw me on a rerun.

Tim,

Awesome. 

Last night was a good 'ole time. I had my mind set on spending $10, but didn't exactly get that accomplished. Kouri's was good as good can be, as per usual. Afterwards, we went to Gorman's for a drink, then to Martini's for a drink, then to Richards to sober up a bit. After leaving Kouri's I spent all of about $8, which isn't too shabby if you ask me.

Tonight, I do nothing. Alan is getting home from his trip and wants to throw himself a welcome home party. I'm not into that whole thing. Well, maybe a party, as long as I don't have to spend any cash.
