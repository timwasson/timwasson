So, shortly after leaving my place, Jaimee returned so she could spend her day off job hunting here in Peoria. While she was here, we went over to Circuit City to buy the new New Found Glory CD, and also found a CD they did of cover songs from movies. It's hilarious and awesome stuff, kids. I recommend either of those CDs. 

I finally got my satellite installed. It works awesome, even in a horrible thunderstorm we had yesterday. It's good to have some new entertainment instead of just cycling through all the commentary tracks on all my DVDs. 

A week from today, I will hopefully have DSL. Then I'll be all set up and rarin' to go. I'm getting really sick of this crappy AOL nonsense.
