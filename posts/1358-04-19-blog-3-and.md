3 and a half working days left now. Ah, sweet freedom. I can smell the freedom. Can you smell it? I can smell it. It smells like bacon.

My clothes don't match today.

I'm hungry.

My last 3 days are going to be at Northwoods, so anyone reading this should stop by and bother me. Chances are I won't be at the kiosk since I tend to just wander around a lot. But still.
