I was just sitting here minding my own business when a little boy walked by that looked exactly like Jack. He was just walking by staring at me. Finally I realized that it WAS Jack, and he was with my sister and Peter. He seemed a bit confused to just "run into me" in public and kept asking why I was here. That's one cute kid, for sure.

3 days left. Then my vacation. Then my awesome new job. Today will be spent turning timwasson.com back into a personal site after being a professional one for way too long.
