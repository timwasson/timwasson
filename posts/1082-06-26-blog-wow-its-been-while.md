Yeah, I haven't posted in quite some time. 

Anyway, picking up where we left off. Friday night Polk and I went to see Minority Report. I liked it for the most part, but it was far, far too long. Saturday was spent moving Jaimee into Peoria and watching The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas. Sunday must have been really uneventful, because I can't remember a thing about it. Monday I did laundry. Tuesday I drew porn. And today is today. And now we're all caught up.

It's really nice to finally have Jaimee living close to me. We don't have to make long trips or plan something special. She can just come over, eat some Hamburger Helper, and watch some TV. 

I'm trying to wrap up some of these drawings so I can dedicate tonight to a [junkmachine][1] facelift. Exciting stuff.
