So, Angie's big group of bowlers turned out to be just 3... me, Angie, and Alan. I bowled pretty well with a 129 and 148. I am such the man.

After the bowling I went to Willow Knolls and met up with Polk and Amy and Steph and we saw The Royal Tenenbaums, which was so amazingly good. I love the Wes Anderson/Owen Wilson team almost as much as I love the Sam/Bruce team and the Coen Brothers. Not quite as much, but getting there.

The highlight of the film for me was the first time you saw inside Owen Wilson's character's house with the paintings in the background and piles of porn on the TV. For some reason or another, that struck me as the funniest thing I have ever seen. 

Anyhoo, after the movie was out I came home and watched some TV and started watching Brazil, which I borrowed from Mr. Polk. I'm just too tired to really get into that movie right now, so I had to stop it. I'll watch it when I'm more awake and in a more Brazilian mood.
