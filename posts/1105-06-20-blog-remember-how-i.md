Remember how I said I wasn't going to go out last night? Color me a liar. After watching a show revealing some magic secrets, I headed down to Crusen's to see Jenny, Dayv, Alan, and some girl named Cami, which I imagine was named after my car.

I wore my old gym shirt from high school, which turned out to be a really terrible idea. I ran into this kid who I knew from high school who I don't have fond memories of. I won't get into a big, long story about why, but I just don't like him. He knew Cami and was trying to mack on her and finally he saw my shirt. He pointed to it, and in a really drunk voice, yelled "dude, holy shit! Did you go there?!" I repliead "Yeah, I was in your class." "No shit? When did you graduate?" "Well, I was in your class. '98, just like you." "Oh, no shit?! What's your name?" At this point I pointed to my shirt where it clearly stated my name, first and last, and thought the conversation was over. He proceeded to walk over and make "small talk", which basically consisted of having the same conversation about my gym shirt, over and over and over again. A few people from Notre Dame saw the shirt and asked questions about it's origin. If nothing else, it got me some attention, but I think it'll be a while before I wear it out to a bar again.

Tonight is Kouri's night, minus Polk. Mister Jim and I are the only confirmed attendees, with a few possibles up in the air. After that, I have no idea what I plan on doing. Something good, though, that's for shizzo.
