I had a dream last night that I woke up and looked in a mirror. I knew something wasn't right, but I couldn't quite tell what it was. Then I realized it was that all my facial hair was completely gone. 

I ran to my mom, asking what happened to my award winning sideburns and goatee, and she said that I had gotten up in the middle of the night and shaved them off, without ever waking up. I didn't believe her, and I was bitter about having to grow them back.
