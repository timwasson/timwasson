More mural painting tonight, but then I'm out of projects. The Jones Brothers cartoon is still waiting for approval and I haven't called the people who want portraits yet, so hopefully I can take care of that on Monday and be busy working this week, as opposed to back on the 'ole couch. I like working again. 

I haven't heard back from my potential distributor yet... not sure how long that process will take. I've been checking out sites for books by other independent publishers, and man, do they ever suck. I'm not completely confident in my writing abilities, but I know mine is better than theirs.
