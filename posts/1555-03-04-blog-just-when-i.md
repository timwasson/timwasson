Just when I think I'm getting ahead of the whole debt thing, something happens that blows it. This time, my wisdom teeth that are getting ripped out of my skull a week from yesterday. It will cost me nearly $900. The very same $900 that was going to get me out of debt 2 months ahead of schedule. Such is life, I guess. And the majority of that will be sent back but due to insurance crap, it'll be out of pocket to let me out the door.
