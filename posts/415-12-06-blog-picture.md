The picture has nothing to do with the post. It's just a picture I took during or blizzard a couple weeks back. Even an ugly chain link fence is pretty with a few feet of snow on it.

I'm getting into the holiday season by setting up my Christmas tree with a little help from Angie, as well as wrapping all the gifts I've bought with a little help from no one. A lesson I've learned from the holiday cheer: Don't get your tree topper at WalMart. Write that one down and keep it with you at all time. Refer to it when temptation strikes.

Quick notes: Almost done with Christmas shopping, bought a new coat, my dog rules out loud, almost all my clothes are clean at this instant, and I am so rich this Christmas it blows my mind. Life is great.
