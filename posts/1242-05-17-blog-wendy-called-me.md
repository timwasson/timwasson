Wendy called me 4 times in the course of about 10 minutes just now. I have bought all her couches, tables, end tables, and desks in her entire house for $200. While I do feel bad about it, I don't feel THAT bad. It's more than she would have goten by leaving it in my garage for 3 weeks before I end up with it for free. 

The Journal Star has contacted me about an article on yours truly, how I'll be a national celebrity and all. It's a weird time for me, for sure. 

I'm bored. I want someone to call me so I can leave my apartment. I'm sick of being here. Hopefully next week, I'll be gone for good. I can't wait.
