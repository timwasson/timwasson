So I'm loving this "off by 12:15 on Fridays" deal. It makes every weekend feel like a 3 day weekend, even though its not. 

So on Friday after work I went home and relaxed a bit and tried to recover from some bad Chinese food or over eating some treats brought in for a coworkers birthday. I felt like crap and considered backing out of the Friday night tradition, fearing that my explosive butt would interrupt the night in a very bad way. Fortunately, by the time dinner time rolled around, I was feeling much better and ended up going out to Richards with Jaimee, Brandon, and Polk. 

Saturday was spent doing various chores and preparations for the BBBQ (The extra B is for BYOBB), followed by a graduation celebration for Anna and Andy. I went to that, then went downtown with Angie to see Brynn, who I haven't seen in months and months. Following a bit of drama and stupidity and being half-ditched, I got to catch up a bit with Brynn before heading home for the night. I'd like to take this oppurtunity to thank Bryan J. for sticking around and not leaving me waiting alone in a crowded bar waiting for someone to come back. I hate being alone in bars. 

And yesterday was busy too. We woke up early and drove out to my parents' house to get his truck so we could get new lawn furniture. They followed us back into town and treated us to breakfast, then we went our seperate ways and we did a bunch of stuff, including getting the lawn furniture, signing up for Dish Network, and more BBBQ preparations.

It's been an extremely busy couple of weeks with very little down time, trying to get this party going and dealing with the new job stuff and the grandpa dying stuff and the housewarming parties and the graduation parties. I'm looking forward to this weekend being over and me having very few obligations for a little while. Maybe I can have a weekend to work on Optimus or just sit around or something. I'm looking forward to that.
