Homeless Day 15 I went up to visit Jaimee. We met up with Wolford and went bowling, which I hadn't done in a long time. I came in #2 every round. Right where I like to be. I left early on Homeless Day 16 to head back to Peoria and get prepared to move on Homeless Day 17, which is today.

I called up my apartment complex early this morning, and she told me I needed to call back around 2 for a definite yes or no. So, now I have 4 hours to kill until I may or may not move into my new pad.

I've been so ridiculously busy the last few days, and it sucks. All I want to do is move into my now place and watch TV or something.
