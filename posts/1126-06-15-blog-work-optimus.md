Work on Optimus was slowed down a bit last night when I opted to watch Jeepers Creepers 2 with Jaimee instead of working on him. Although my tests with the fiberglass resin have gone great. 

I got myself a much sought-after gmail address. I haven't the foggiest idea what I'll use it for, really. Mostly I just wanted it so I could brag to others about it. I keep checking it to see if I have any invitations. I'd sure like to trade one for something on [gmail swap][1]. 

My legs hurt today. Hopefully soon they'll be used to this jogging/stairs thing. The vitamins I've started taking haven't lived up to their promise of more energy. I have my fingers crossed though.
