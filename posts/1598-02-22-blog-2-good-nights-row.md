Yep. 

Well, I had made plans with Fabish on Tuesday to eat at Garner's last night, for $3/pound wing night. We ate at Garner's, just me and him. It was the first time since high school that me and Fabish just hung out by ourselves, and it was good.

Fabish really wants to see Hannibal, but had never seen Silence of the Lambs, so we went back to my place and watched it while we drank beer. Mullens stopped by briefly but I think he got sick of me and Fabish making fun of him, so he left. 

After Silence of the Lambs, we watched whatever was left of the Grammies. Is it just me, or did Eminem's performance absolutely kick ass? My favorite part was how they tried to bleep out some words, but missed.
