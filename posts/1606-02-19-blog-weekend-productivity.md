I actually accomplished everything I wanted to accomplish this weekend. Well, not one thing, but I was close. 

Friday I got home and cleaned my apartment a little. Becky and Angie stopped by, made me some dinner, then we watched a movie and I drank beer and they drank wine. I called it a night kind of early for a weekend, and slept for about 14 hours.

I woke up on Saturday and felt like crap. I had a sore throat and a headache. That really sucks, because I never get sick. I don't even know how to deal with it. The last time I've felt that bad was like 7th grade, and I know full well I didn't feel THAT bad. It didn't stop me from complaining though. So, I spent basically the entire day doing laundry, which I will never do again. From now on, I will do my laundry at more regular intervals. I think that will be better. An aside to the story... I think the new detergent I'm using is giving me a rash. That REALLY sucks, because I don't want to have to wash every single one of my clothes again. Ah well. So anyhoo... Saturday night I was planning on visiting Jaimee, but my laundry took me too long, and I had obligations with my dad and Angie, so I wouldn't have left Peoria until pretty late. That plus the fact that I had felt progressively worse all day on Saturday kept me stranded with nothing to do on a Saturday night. I got guilted into socializing with Alan, his girlfriend, and this girl Julie who just broke up with her boyfriend. It sucked. I didn't want to be social and friendly. I just wanted to either sleep, draw, or watch Mad Max or something. I did what I could with the friendly thing, but went to sleep early. 

I was dreading getting out of bed on Sunday. I mean, I had felt worse and worse all day Saturday, so how would I feel on Sunday? Eventually I got out of bed and felt great. I was fine. I ironed some clothes, ate lunch with Sarah and Robert, then me and Alan went to work with getting cable to the bedrooms. 

One word can be used to describe the cable installation process: easy. It was unbelievable. Remember how with the phone lines, me and Alan could do nothing right? Well, with the cable, we could do no wrong. So, we now have cable in the bedrooms. How impressive is that? Our next plan is to take cable into the bathroom, and get a little 5" TV or something to watch during showers or baths or on the toilet or something. That should be really cool.

So anyway, the big event on Sunday was the new episode of Jackass, and afterwards I just went to my room and fiddled online and drew some pictures while some people watched a movie in the living room. It's nice having cable in my room. Very nice. And a phone, too. It's like I'm living in the future. 

And now it's Monday and I'm at work. And it sucks. And I want to go home. And I'm stuck here another 8.5 hours.
