Things are starting to look up. Jaimee called me from Albaqueerkey, safe and sound. It's a sad time no matter what, but hopefully we made the right decision.

The house situation is sketchy. The chances that we still have the house are good, but it means a lot more paperwork for yours truly. It may also mean that we need to close really soon and pay double rent for a few months. So, this isn't a very smooth transaction, but we'll get it dealt with.

I got Gone in 60 Seconds yesterday. The original. Up until a week ago, I didn't even know "an original" existed. It was made in the 70's and it's not great. The action scenes are awesome, but the rest of it is pretty terrible. It's still good for a laugh.
