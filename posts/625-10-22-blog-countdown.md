I've been trying to get this job for a long, long time. It's a CD for schools in California. It's a big project, and I could really use the money. I didn't think I stood a chance in hell of getting it, but applied on a whim and sent them my webpage address.

Well, they loved the webpage and wanted to see a sample CD, so I mailed them one. Then they wanted a demo reel, so I mailed them mine. Then they wanted a print portfolio, so I just got back from sending that off. Let's do a countdown on what I've invested (monetarily) into this project:

1 demo reel: $2.00  
tape case: $1.50  
tape cover: $1.50  
2 sample CDs: $1.00  
2 CD covers: $2.00  
10 color prints: $8.00  
15 b&w prints: $5.00  
3 seperate shipping charges: $15.00

That's $36 total I've spent trying to get this project so far. If I don't get it, I'm going to be one bitter, bitter man. $36 is 2 VERY nice meals, 5 movies, 2 DVDs, 3CDs, groceries for 2 weeks. I'll be so mad if it turns out I just threw that away.

Anyway, that's all I have to say about that.
