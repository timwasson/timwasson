Sunday was crazy productive for this kid. Not only did Optimus get a little bit of attention, but my latest project did as well. I also spent a good long time cleaning. Yes, cleaning. And not just straightening, mind you, but I scrubbed the bathroom and got on my hands and knees with bleach and a sponge, going to town. I got rid of a bunch of trash, did like 5 loads of laundry, all folded and hanging and not wrinkly, and even vacuumed. I actually do like living in a house that's slightly cleaner, but I sure hate to clean. Maybe this time I'll make an effort to keep things a bit nicer looking.

Anyway, so that night was The Grudge where I played the 3rd wheel to Tiffany and Wolfie until Randy joined the party. After giving a hard time to the cashier and sprinkling my popcorn with the awesomest white cheddar topping stuff, we entered the almost empty stadium theater.

Anyone who knows me for more than a few seconds knows I'm a huge fan of the horror genre. After a huge drought of horror movies in the 90's, they're back and weirder than ever. Thanks to 28 Days Later, Dawn of the Dead, and Shaun of the Dead, zombie movies are cool again, and I couldn't be happier. Well, okay, I'd be happier if slasher movies that weren't self-referential came back into style (the newer slasher flicks are pretty much just Freddy vs. Jason and Jason X, but with the new Chucky and slew of "versus" movies coming out, maybe that will change), but for now I'm happy with zombies and creepy Japanese influenced horrors.

And speaking of creepy... holy crap. This movie freaked me out more than a PG-13 movie should be allowed to do. There was a lot of boring parts, but a ton of creepy parts too. I won't bother with spoilers or any of that nonsense, but overall it was a solid movie. That should be expected with Raimi producing it, though. 

So for the past couple of weeks, I've been working out 45 minutes to an hour per day, with a balance of lifting and riding my elliptical machine and recumbant bike. I think I'm finally over that hump where I'm tired all the time and into that area where I'm awake all the time. I haven't lost a whole lot of weight, since lifting makes me painfully hungry and I've been eating pretty much whatever and whenever I feel like it since starting my exercise in large doses schedule. My arms are definitely getting bigger, however, which is always a good thing. 

As a public and personal note: Blandon and Kristi, it's been far too long since I've enjoyed your company. Are you hanging out with us on Friday or what? If not, we should arrange a mid-week meal to make up for your absences. 

Another side note: My new camera makes me ache for another photo party. Maybe I'll throw a smaller one to tide me over until Polk's bashy bash photo party.

And the last side note: I'm considering throwing a New Years Party with the rule that, to enter said party, you need to kiss at least every person of the opposite sex, and even people of the same sex if you're feeling up to it, at midnight. Who's with me?
