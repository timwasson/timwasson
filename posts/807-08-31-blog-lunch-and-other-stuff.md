Just got back from lunch. I had no idea how many people would end up coming, and they ended up paying for my lunch too. The people that showed up to my final lunch for future "cool list" reference: Shane, Jim, Jerry, Matt, Becki, Shep, Ed, Kala, Rob, and 3 former Iona employees just happened to be there so Roz, Val, and Sheryl joined us as well. 3 or 4 others came to me personally and apologized for not being able to make it.

I got my final paycheck, which included pay for vacation and sick days. It was a big check, and will keep me alive and kickin' with no income for a good 2 months at least. It's good to have at least a little fallback. 

I gave up my key to the building just seconds ago. Very symbollic if you ask me. 3 hours from now, I'll be leaving Iona and I can't come back until I'm invited. I'm giving up the right to come here voluntarily.

What a weird, weird feeling.
