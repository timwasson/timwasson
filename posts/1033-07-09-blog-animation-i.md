The animation I did for Iona went over well, and I have another meeting with them on Monday to discuss revisions, and gasp, some illustration work as well. Steve told me that they were considering making a transition into a company that simply sold multimedia projects and all their workers would be freelancers. That makes sense, and it's good for me if they keep throwing work my way. I've discussed my freelancing with my boss at IM, and she doesn't mind a bit until it starts interfering with my work with them. I don't know if that includes me coming to work tired or not.
