It's a shame that the Hobbit link stopped working. The description of the book included Bilbo Baggins, transvestites, hookers, and houseboats originally. It was probably posted by some disgruntled WalMart employee. It was funny while it lasted.

Work today was uneventful, except while I was changing the blade on our miter saw. The nut holding the blade in place was stuck and wouldn't move for the life of me. Finally I just put the wrench on and pushed with all the force in my body, and it finally gave. Great, except that my hand went flying into the back, where the saw attaches to our table. I tore a lot of skin off my pinky and ring finger of my left hand. It hurt really, really, really bad.

The last 2 days at work I've been building displays, with more to build by our big 40th anniversary. It seems my job has moved from framer to carpenter, which I enjoy a lot more. Power tools and huge chunks of wood. Perfect. 

The meeting at Sully's went well, and next Sunday will be mural #2 on the door outside. I hope it's warmer by then. I don't know if I'll be able to paint with gloves on, but we'll give it a shot. 

I ate dinner tonight with John Zarr. He's a nice kid who I don't see nearly often enough. We hung out a lot in high school and really tried to get him out of his shell. When his sister died, he kind of cut everyone off. I think I've mentioned that before. Anyway, it's good to see him on a 1-on-1 basis again, even if it's sporadically, and even if it's because all his friends have moved away or have been shipped out.
