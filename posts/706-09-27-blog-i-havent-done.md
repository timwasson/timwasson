I haven't done much today, basically because I can't even think of anything to do.

I've given my information out to everyone I know, and now it's just sort of a waiting game. This part sucks, especially since I've been out of money for so long and I'm getting the urge to buy things. Those who know me well know that I'm no good at resisting that urge.
