I didn't do much of anything last night. I am an exciting guy. I'd like to go out tonight, drinking or something, but I don't want to spend the money. After paying off my computer and other bills, I only have a couple hundred bucks in the bank, and I like having some sort of cushion for myself. The only way I will go out tonight is if it's a BYOB type situation, and the only place in the Peoria area I know of that's BYOB is Shooters, the most god awful strip club in the universe. Ah well.

You know what's great about the internet? Tracking packages. It's fantastic. My computer parts left California this morning. UPS provides an "approximate delivery date", but FedEx doesn't. When will my computer be here, damn it?
