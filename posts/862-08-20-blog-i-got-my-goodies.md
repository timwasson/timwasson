That's right. I got my stuff. And I only got 1 lame item.

Included were [one of these][1], [2 of these][2], [a stupid pair of headphones][3], [an awesome region free DVD player][4], [a surround sound system][5], and [a set of speakers][6].

I think I'll break even on the deal... if not, I'll make like $20. 

I haven't listed any of my stuff on eBay yet. It's boring to do, and I'm tired and want to watch TV or something.
