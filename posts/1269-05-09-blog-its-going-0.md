It's going to rain tonight and tomorrow. Good for grass, bad for me, since I was supposed to make money painting outside tomorrow. 

Polk, we still on for Kouri's? Outside may not work, but Kouri's food is good inside, even.

The closing on my house is Tuesday. Tomorrow I have a meeting with a computer store to sell parts on my website. Since The Screen Savers will make me a national celebrity and turn me into a common household name, I want to profit when I can. I love to profit.
