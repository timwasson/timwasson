So today is the big day. I drive up to Kankakee for the rehearsal dinner, and I stay to see my best friend get married tomorrow. It's so weird. That kid is younger than I am. It's just crazy. I felt old when my sister got married, but I feel REALLY old now that my best friend is. 

Well, the current owner of my house went to her bank, and it turns out she's only asking for an additional $800. If worse comes to worse and the bank turns her down, my dad and I have decided to just borrow an extra $800 on the house and give it to her. Over the course of a 30 year mortgage, $800 is just a couple of bucks a month. It's not worth the extra hassle and headaches for that little money. So things are looking up. All we can do is sit and wait for people to make their important decisions.
