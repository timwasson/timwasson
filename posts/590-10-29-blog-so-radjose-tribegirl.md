So, <a href="http://rad_jose.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">rad_jose</a>, <a href="http://tribegirl.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">tribegirl</a>, and <a href="http://devilpuppet.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">devilpuppet</a>(sorta) have all joined in the "one fact/one memory" theme of November. It's obvious to me that it's what the cool kids do, and I, of course, set the standard for cool kids.

It's been quite a week so far, and I'm starting to feel guilty for neglecting my dog as I drink brews and eat pizza with random people every night of the week. To make up for my poor parenting, this weekend will be spent mostly at home, taking care of some odds and ends that need taken care of, and doing nothing in particular otherwise. 

I just got a $75 gift certificate to Crutchfield that I forgot I was even going to get. I have no idea what I'll do with it, but I'll probably sell it on eBay.
