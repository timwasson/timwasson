I sure do love Fridays at Kouri's, even when they happen on Sundays. Tonight it was me, Atomic, some kid I think was named Kevin, Polk, Rachel, Dana, Brandon, and Joshy T. It was good times, and super cheap for me because last week was so expensive. The only thing that could have made it better was Schwa. And Jen. And if Freddy vs. Jason was playing on the TVs while we were eating, because that's the greatest movie ever made (except for the Evil Deads).

Tomorrow I finish my fish chair, hopefully and finally. 

And finally, look at [the awesomest LJ community ever][1].
