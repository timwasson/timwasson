What I wanted to do last night: Nothing.  
What I did last night: Lots of stuff. 

I went back to my parent's place to eat some dinner. Afterwards I drove my dad to pick up his car that's been in storage for the winter. How ironic that he left it in there all winter, and the night he gets it out, it starts snowing. 

So, I went back to my place and Angie and Mullens called. They were going to come over and make some dinner and watch a movie. Of course I didn't have a problem with that. I had just eaten at my parents, but that didn't stop me from eating again. We watched Seven, which is a great movie, but long. They didn't leave until around 11, so I didn't get more sleep, as I had planned to do. 

Mullens asked me if I wanted to go to St. Louis tonight for their Mardi Gras. I made some excuses, but I think I'm going to go. I'm young and stupid and I should do this. It's like I owe it to myself or something.

I felt craptastic all day yesterday. Not sick, just lousy. I don't know exactly why, but I feel a little better today. I wouldn't put myself in the good mood category, but I'm getting closer. I've just had a lot on my mind, which usually leaves me discontent with some part of my life. That's where I am right now. I don't know exactly what's bothering me, but I think I have it narrowed down quite a bit. Tonight will be a good night to just not worry about it. I can worry about it some other time.
