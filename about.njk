<p>
my name is tim, and i am so excited to go back to this style of website.
</p>
<p>
I started making websites in 1994, coding with Notepad and making my own graphics in Paint. Over the years I graduated to other technologies, but always missed the oldschool web dev.
</p>
<p>
This site was built on <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a>, using <a href="https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog">this starter kit</a>, and then I imported a bunch of <a href="/archive">old blog posts</a> ported over from the sites I've maintained throughout the years. These include my old LiveJournal posts, website posts through custom CMSs, and Drupal.
</p>
<p>
I also imported all my old <a href="/tweets">tweets</a> so they won't be lost forever once that site finally dies.
</p>
<p>
The site deploys via <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-neocities">a Github Action that deploys to Neocities</a>, building the site and all posts on the fly.
</p>
<p>
I'm still building sites for fun and professionally, all these years later. I will still never be a consistent blogger.
